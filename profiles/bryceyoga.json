It was tough, lonely and I wasn't making any money to support my daughter or myself. But, when I started to reach out to the community around me, my teaching career started to flourish. It's so easy to get lost in competition and feel threatened by the incredibly talented teachers out there. But, there is truly room for everyone and the best projects are the ones I've collaborated with people on. Like the upcoming 200hr Yoga Teacher Training we are co-teaching with @mackenzieyoga and @mathieuboldronyoga !! There is still some room so join us this June 18-July 14 for a life changing and immersive Yoga experience. More info via the link in our bio. #yogateachertraining #fitflowflytraining #fitflowfly",

(I was actually telling him to get out of the shot here üò≥). But now that I look back at it, I think it's actually better with him there! Remember, there is room for everyone in this yoga thing, it's up to you to open your hearts. #love #roomforeveryone üì∏ @jake_paul_white Everyone in @aloyoga ... except that guy of course...he's just wearing cheer.",

This past 300hr Yoga Teacher training was truly a life-changing experience. Although I'm still processing the effects of it, I know I have grown, my mind is clear, my heart open. Wishing all of you amazing teachers the same. ‚ù§üôèüòòüí™ This past month has truly been a life changing experience and each and everyone of you has impacted my life and helped me grow.
