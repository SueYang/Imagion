So I took a leap of faith and hit the road to pursue my passions. \nI‚Äôve now spent the last 3 years traveling full time while living out of my grandmother's old van that I personally converted into my dream adventure-mobile. \nThe people I‚Äôve met, places I‚Äôve been and experiences I‚Äôve had (both good and bad), have significantly changed my life in a positive way. Huge THANK YOU to everyone that has supported my journey along the way! \nMy only wish is that I can help inspire a few of you to get out there and chase your own dreams!",

Surprisingly, almost all of them said: ‚Äúno, I haven‚Äôt had a chance to make it there yet‚Äù.\nIts crazy to me how many people have taken expensive trips to far away lands but haven't even seen their own backyard! So after that, I set out on a road trip around the U.S. to show people that some of the most incredible places in the world are all around us.
