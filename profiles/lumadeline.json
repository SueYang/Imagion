      "description": "\"You will never have to force anything that's truly meant to be.\" 🌿 Just weeks before our trip to Maui, I connected with @ellenfisher on Instagram. I was so inspired by her natural lifestyle on Maui as well as her vegan food. After we arrived Maui, we messaged each other and hoped to meet up. But with our busy travel schedule and her house renovation, we couldn’t find a time that fits both of us. So we wished each other well and hope to meet somewhere else in the future. Then on one of our last days on Maui, we decided spontaneously to visit Iao Valley since we had 30 mins to spare before taking our helicopter ride. Just I walked around the area to take photos, I noticed a girl in the parking lot with beautiful blond hair and stunning figure, but I couldn’t see her face. As I passed by her, I looked at her again and realized it was Ellen!!! I couldn’t believe it! We introduced our families to each other and got to spend a brief time together. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 We love how she and Andrew decided to move to Maui for the wellbeing of the kids and for their commitment of the healthy lifestyle. It is truly inspiring. The little Elvis showed my kids how to swing in a banyan tree. And Sandy, OMG, I wish I could take him with me. He is just the cutes! So that’s the story how I meant to meet Ellen Fisher. Take a look at her account, watch her YouTube videos and give her a follow. She offers so many great tips on healthy eating as well as living. 🎬🌿",

We are all world citizens and living without borders! I love how social media connects people as well as inspires the way we live, cook, decorate and travel. It pushes us to try and do things that we couldn't have never thought of! (Sadly, there are also a lots of things I don't like about social media, hacking, privacy invasion, copyright infringements...) But I would like to focus on the good. Social media is a tool, which is up to us how we use it. For now, sending you sunny vibes from California and wish you a great weekend! ☀️😎🙌",

I had studied and worked there for another five years before moving to Switzerland, where both of our kids were born. Another five years later, we moved to Germany and had a great time. A few year later, around last year this time, we crossed the ocean and moved to California. 😎🌴☀️ And no, I don't go back to China often, because my side of the family live in New Zealand. So that's kind of the answer I normally gave when people ask me where I am from. 😜 Now, you go! PS: our brekkie was cashew banana cream topped with granola, fresh berries and pistachios, and some \"GIANT\" organic strawberries! 😋✌️🍓",

PS: can you spy a smiley 😊 in the picture? 👀\n\nWhat you’ll need:\n- 1/2 cup coconut oil, melted, plus more for pan - 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pan - 2 tbsps ground flaxseed - 6 tbsps of filtered water\n- 3/4 cup brown sugar - 1 tsp aluminum free baking soda - 1/4 teaspoon sea salt - 2 1/3 cups mashed very ripe bananas - 1 tsp pure vanilla extract\nHow it’s made:\n1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\n2. Mix ground flaxseed with filtered water. Let stand until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir to combine.\n3. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together coconut oil and brown sugar. Stir in flaxseed mixture, vanilla extract and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.\n4. Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. Serve warm and enjoy!",
