It feels almost comical to have the fruits of those efforts show up in the mail as something that fits in one hand and is made of paper.  Regardless, I couldnâ€™t be more excited to announce the release of my memoir on May 16.  I owe a huge thanks to so many people for helping bring this book to life. Most notably Kelly Cordes for walking with me on the journey, and to my beautiful family for putting up with my tendency to become engulfed in projects - I love you all.  #THEPUSH",
