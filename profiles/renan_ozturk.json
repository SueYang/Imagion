Even in my short lifetime it's been startling to see first hand places that used to have snow and glaciers melt out and fade away. To me the high mountains always feel more 'alive' when covered in snow and ice.  A lot of recent trips to the Himalaya have shown the irreversible warming, glaciers are melting out and the even elders know why. While I still fly often for work, I'm choosing to #actonclimate by living in a passive solar home, driving an electric car, cutting out factory farmed meat and dairy from my diet, and doing as much as I can. ~\n\nPhoto of me by @cedarwright on our mission to make the first ascent of the SW Cat Ear Spire in Pakistan's Trango Valley, one of the spikey summits in the center of the frame.  @thenorthface",

Most notably among these was Teddy Roosevelt and his powerful vision to enact the 1906 American Antiquities Act. Consider for a moment a world without the sacred rocks and stone temples of our heritage, or without the great ranges and life-supporting waters, open to all and owned by all, who wish to connect with the natural world. We fundamentally believe our National Monuments, Parks and public lands are vital shared spaces and any attempt to change them threatens our heritage, destroying part of the very core of who we have become as a nation. It also erodes the livelihood of 7.6 million people who are employed in outdoor recreation. We stand with the outdoor industry, our customers and the overwhelming majority of Americans who oppose any legislation that would reduce or devalue our National Monuments, Parks and public lands. Protecting and preserving access to these places is core to our mission to enable all people to explore outdoors.\" #NeverStopExploring",

      "description": "For Earth Day I wanted to explain how what we witnessed during the @natgeo @thenorthface #TheLastHoneyHunter expedition changed my worldview.  I couldn't quite articulate it so here is the wisdom from @jetbutteflies: ~\n\nIn Nepal’s remote Hongu River valley, the Kulung tribe still practice an ancient and powerful form of animism that is overseen by local shamans. For the Kulung, the entire universe is encapsulated within this isolated watershed. The very first humans descended from the snowy Himalayan peaks to the north almost twenty generations ago. The Kulung know that when they die, their souls will join a growing congress of ancestors that live under the massive rock outcropping to the south. ~\n\nOne does not choose to become a shaman. Rather, the spirits come to select individuals during their dreams and possess them. Thus conscripted, the shamans find their sacred tools using their intuition and dreams as guidance. They sew sacred headdresses from porcupine quills and perform healing and religious functions for the communities - often at great physical and psychic cost to themselves. ~\n\nIn the west, we struggle to find connection with our own place in the world - to understand our own traditions, dreams and messages from our own ancestors.  Earth Day is a start. We are creating our own rituals and striving for a connection to the soil from which we have all risen, and into which we will all someday return. ~\n\nAlso we are proud to announce that the World Premiere for the film will be held at this years @mountainfilm festival in Telluride!! ~\n\n@irving_matthew @sadiequarrier @dzifoundation @ben_knight @taylorfreesolo @m_synnott",

Like the rapid increase in global communications and connectivity, small roads are expanding across Nepal’s steep hills at an alarming rate. Before this, amenities like cement or acrylic paint were rare due to the cost and difficulty of transport. ~\n\nDirectly across the small town square from the prayer wheel stands an ancient willow tree, upwards of five feet in diameter and a medieval Buddhist chorten.

      "description": "Observing the process of hunting in Nepal // words by @nomadic49ak- It's a strange feeling as a guide to travel to a far off land & be the hunter myself this time, rather than let others take care of the animal. I made the initial cuts and then I could tell the guides & porters were eager to begin their work. The Nepali gentlemen made quick work of the sheep. After skinning, a slit was made to remove the stomach & intestines. The intestines were cleaned out, and the stomach was opened to remove all grass being digested inside. At that point I figured we would quarter & split up the loads of meat since there more than enough bodies to help carry out. Instead, the whole carcass - organs, stomach and intestines - were loaded into ONE basket and one porter took off back to camp. That was obviously his job and he took pride in the load of sheep meat. There will be no waste of this old ram. ~\n\n@bennyob301 @irish_goodbye @jetbutterflies @sitkagear @thenorthface @yeti - slow shutter shot on the @sonyalpha a7rii with a @syrp_ ND",

      "description": "@sodapopchamling is a glorious misfit - bending strings and expectations in Nepal. ~\n\nHer Nepali parents traveled as part of the famous British Gurkha Rifles brigade, and Sareena grew up in Hong Kong, Singapore and the UK. Her rebellious streak was fed by the heyday of the punk scene. She taught herself to play guitar - starting by making up her own chords, then graduated to writing songs and starting bands. ~\n\nUpon returning to Nepal, she helped crystalize Nepal’s vibrant punk and metal music scene - singing original music in Nepali and English that tackled political and social issues, as well as gave young fans a rare chance to let loose and rebel. ~\n\nAnyone who has been thrashed in a mosh pit or sweated through your boots skanking at a ska show understands the poignant liberation tucked into the backbeat of a ska song, in power chords played loud and hard and fast. It’s a freedom that is often felt most strongly in the hours after the show closes, ears still ringing, soaked in silence and cool air. ~ \nSareena is like this. She is built of silence more than of noise. At first glance - or first read - one might see only a rebel and a screamer. But, have a conversation with her and instead you see a strong woman pulled by deep dreams of equality and happiness, driven by a real love for her community and her family. Sareena lives her values in a way that few people can claim to. She is a mother of two adopted children. A philosopher. A climber. A teacher. She, quite literally, rocks. ~\n\nWords by @jetbutterflies!! w @climber.abiral @pasang_lhamu_sherpa_akita @rudy.le @yeti #nepaliloveyou #punk",

      "description": "@pasang_lhamu_sherpa_akita is one of the busiest women in Nepal. ~\n\nThe week before this photo was taken, she was on a flight back from New York City where she received the prestigious Tenzing Norgay award from the Explorer’s Club. In less than a week since, she has attempted to put up a new route on an unclimbed peak in the Annapurna region and left to join her teammates on the first Nepali Women’s Expedition to climb Mt. Kanchenjunga (28,333 ft) - the third tallest mountain on the planet. ~\n\nShe is Nepal’s leading female mountain guide, and has received international attention for her groundbreaking ascents of Mt. Everest and K2, as well as her work helping remote communities rebuild after the devastating 2015 earthquakes in Nepal. ~\n\nPasang grew up in the fabled Khumbu valley that leads up to the slopes of Mt Everest. She lost her parents at a young age, and raised her younger sister as she pursued a career in the mountains. Often the only woman climbing, Pasang struggled to break through in an industry (and society) with a very limited vision of what women can, or should, do. ~\n\nBut this is steadily changing, thanks to pioneering individuals including Pasang. She has become a national hero without losing her kindness and connection to her family and her community. Her example has inspired a generation of young women to climb and to strive for more than what society demands.  And this is just the beginning. ~\n\nWords by @jetbutterflies @sodapopchamling @climber.abiral  @rudy.le @yeti @camp4collective \n#nepaliloveyou #mountainninja #sherpa",

      "description": "Expedition update // words by @jetbutterflies // Annapurna III and Nilgiri backlit by lightning from our acclimatization camp in a sea of scree above the small village of Ngawal, 16,000 feet. ~\n\nA few hours outside of Kathmandu, the main highway crosses the Marshyangdi river. Here, the river is cut into a steep valley and tumbles violently between massive boulders, angry and deep. If you turn right and follow the river upstream, it undulates through cliffs and canyons, past small villages with men and oxen pacing across thimble-sized terraces on the steep slopes of the valley. The river calms as you gain elevation, shifting from blue to azure. ~\n\nThis magical valley sneaks around the Himalayas themselves and into the dusty rain shadow between the fertile mid-hills of Nepal and the high-altitude desert of Tibet. There are few places on earth where you can experience so much vertical relief in all directions. This geography creates a certain silence, a gravity that is nearly impossible to describe. It leaves you feeling tiny. Quiet. Humble. Nauseous from the thin air, from the realization of our own insignificance. ~  @sodapopchamling @pasang_lhamu_sherpa_akita @climber.abiral  @rudy.le @royalenfield @yeti @irish_goodbye @thenorthface @reddigitalcinema @sonyalpha",
