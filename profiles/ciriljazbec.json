      "description": "The Zastava 750 is a motif frequently encountered in the countries of former Yugoslavia. It is widely known by its nickname ‚ÄúFiƒáo‚Äù or \"Fiƒáa\" in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian, ‚ÄúFiƒço‚Äù or ‚ÄúFiƒçko‚Äù in Slovene, and ‚ÄúFikjo‚Äù in Macedonia. In the village of ≈†hlegovo, I noticed one in a deserted street where I felt as if I had stepped into the past. Fiƒço was created by Fiat soon after World War II. It was first presented at the 1955 Geneva Motor Show, where it was hailed as the ‚Äúeconomic miracle‚Äù of post-war Italy. These cars were not only popular and widespread among the people throughout Yugoslavia, they were also used by the police, by emergency services, the army and driving schools, and they competed in races. Nowadays, they can still be seen on the roads of former Yugoslav republics; a couple still exist in Slovenia as well. #zastava750 #fico",

People flocked to it in droves to play hockey and skate, to ride sleds or walk to the island in the middle of the lake. The frozen lake even hosted motorcycle races.\n\nThis was taken a week ago and unfortunately due to higher temperature the ice is no longer safe. #Bled #lake #island #frozen #Slovenia #ice #igslovenia",

      "description": "Every October, for the past few years, Milan Kastelic, a local of Postojna starts growing his beard. This is only to meet the criteria of becoming a perfomer in the respected 5-day Living Nativity performance in the famous @postojnacave. After the performance, the beard must go, as Mrs Kastelic does not approve. \n#Postojna cave #Slovenia #nativity #igslovenia#performance #underworld #cave #portrait #postojnacave",

A tradition, going back to 1989 is held every holiday season. She is just one of about 150 performers ‚Äì mostly locals, who  gather here every day for 5 days. This cave, which has been forming for millions of years, out of sight, but right under their feet has been part of their community for centuries. A special story in a special place which brings together special people. This is just one part of their magic. #Postojnacave #Slovenia #living #nativity #performance #cave",
