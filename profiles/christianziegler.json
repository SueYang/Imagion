At night, kinkajous are the dominant animals in the Balsa tree (Ochroma pyramidale) and chase everybody out of the canopy so they can have the nectar to themselves - each flower can hold up to 50 ml of sugary nectar. Kinkajous are very important pollinators and seed dispersers of many species of rain forest trees, and they are the primary pollinator of the Ochroma tree pictured here. The kinkajous visit to drink nectar from the huge flowers and while drinking their furry cheeks get dusted in pollen that they carry to the next flower. This picture was taken from atop of a 100 ft tower to access the forest canopy in central Panama. @thephotosociety @natgeocreative #Panama #conservation",

      "description": "Photo by @christianziegler Coiba island – the largest uninhabited island off the Pacific coast of the Americas. Coiba National Park is a beautiful reminder of what tropical ecosystems can be; an island covered in pristine forest sitting in a rich ocean just off the coast of Panama. I am super excited to be heading back to Coiba today for two-weeks with @peter_houlihan and @pelletk to continue to document the biodiversity of this unique island ecosystem. This is the first time that I will be back in the field after a year recovering from suffering a stroke in July 2015.... It’s been a tough journey but I’m almost there and it’s wonderful to be getting back to the forest to do what I enjoy most! I won't post for 2 weeks, (no wifi), but after:) Thanks to International League of Conservation Photographers @ilcp_photographers, el Ministerio de Ambiente Panama @miambientepma, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for all their support. #Coiba #Biodiversity #Panama #UNESCO #Conservation #Gratitude",

Portrait of an older male Bonobo, probably around 35-years old. It is incredibly difficult to see and photograph bonobos in the wild; we tracked them for weeks before I could get close enough to take a portrait.  I enjoyed photographing this male very much, he was so relaxed just sitting in a tree – he seemed to be thinking about something. @thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative #Wpph14 #conservation #ecology #DRC #congo #bonobo",
