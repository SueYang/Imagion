      "description": "Scarlett Hooft Graafland took this photograph on the shores of Belo sur Mer in #Madagascar, using local fishermen and their canoes as her subject. In each canoe, you can see the knees of a fisherman poking out. When traveling to remote and often harsh landscapes, Hooft Graafland gets to know the local community and collaborates with them closely to make her surreal scenes. 'Discovery', the artist's solo exhibition at Flowers Gallery (@flowersgallery) in #London, is on view through today, Saturday, April 29th. All images on view are printed directly from the artist's negatives. // #fineartphotography #contemporaryphotography #belosumer #landscapelovers #analoguevibes #analogphotography #tinypeopleinbigplaces",

      "description": "In 1946, the same year he took this photograph at #6thAvenue in #NYC, the great photographer #ToddWebb wrote the following in his journal: “I am full of things to do, and I have no spare time on my hands. It seems like a very good life. I am broke. But what the hell, you can’t have everything.” Before he found success as a photographer, Webb had been a stockbroker, a gold prospector, and a forest ranger. He wrote stories, though they were never published. He served in the Second World War. Now, his photographs are being show in two exhibitions: 'City Seen' at The Museum of the City of New York (@museumofcityny) and 'Down Any Street' at The Curator Gallery (@thecuratorgallery).

In the book, the artist touches on the expectation of women to be \"kawaii\" (meaning \"cute\"). She herself often chooses to be \"kowai\" (meaning \"scary\") instead. \"I have no special message or purpose when I take photos,\" Miyazaki told @CNN last summer, \"I only hope that visitors approach my photography with an open mind -- with as much freedom of thinking as I try to have when I create a picture.\" Head on over to publisher Lawrence King (@laurencekingpub) to get your copy of 'Girl on Girl.' // #femalegaze #selfportrait",

      "description": "Scarlett Hooft Graafland photographed this 11-year-old boy on the island of #Malekula in #Vanuatu. As with elements in many of the artists photograph, the yellow ship in his arms references the place's history. The ship is a model of HMS Resolution, the preferred ship of 18th century Captain James Cook. \"The boy is a descendant of the chief of the tribe that welcomed Captain Cook to the island, two and a half centuries ago, when Cook’s ship laid at anchor at the same spot,\" Hooft Graafland explains in the image's caption. This photo and others from the artist's many travels are on view at Flowers Gallery (@flowersgallery) in #London through today. // #ScarlettHooftGraafland #fineartphotography #contemporaryphotograph",

'Down Any Street: Todd Webb’s Photographs of New York 1946-1960' at The Curator Gallery (@thecuratorgallery) is on view now. Shapiro's exhibition coincides with 'City Seen', a large Todd Webb retrospective at The Museum of the City of New York (@museumofcityny).",
