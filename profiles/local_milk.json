      "description": "Our last day in Japan has been a far cry from this tea house that @thedenizenco & I take our retreat guests to each year. It's been all Tokyo lights, loud beer bars, ramen up next, Shinjuku shopping malls. All city. I can smell the smoky izakaya, almost taste the crispy pork belly and fermented bean sprouts. Probably going to eat that too. I'm excited to move on, but I think it would be with great pain in my heart if I didn't know we would be back in October. I'm so grateful for all the time I've been able to spend in this amazing country‚Äîit will be, at the end of this year, almost 5 months over the past 3 years. I'm painfully American, of course. Casual and (even though I don't consider myself loud) definitely louder than the Japanese. I've tabled my thoughts on the concept of home as a place and instead I'm thinking about what community means to us. I feel so connected to a global community, and, though scattered, it feels no less like a family. I could complain all day about the digital world and social media (there are so many potential problems) but for my community, I'm grateful. This weird internet work community has led me to so many real life friendships, awesome job opportunities, and life changing experiences. So thanks, IG. Thanks, frans. And üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª üáØüáµ. Follow along on our last day on IG stories! #localmilkabroad",

We travel the world working and teaching‚Äîa privilege I'm incredibly grateful. Tomorrow we head back to the states after 6 weeks of living and working in Japan, a country that inspires my work as a cook & an artist. I've been researching and experimenting with ingredients here & writing recipes as well as teaching all over the country with women who inspire me alongside my husband. It's a dream come true, one I've had since as long as I can remember. I'm excited to be back home‚Äîand then excited to leave again come the end of May. This crazy life we built brings me such joy. I'm excited to watch it unfold, the hard & the good. For now we know it's the right choice for our little family even though we aren't sure where we'll land. Thank you for supporting my work, for reading and following along. I have intentionally slowed down my blogging and social media over the past six weeks while I work on content & ideas (our first intensive 6-week ecourse, the book, and tons of new travel guides and content for the blog to release over the next year!)‚Äîso thanks for hanging around and stay tuned for it all as well as our Faroe Islands retreat and Copenhagen one day workshops in August! And we still have spots left for our Greece & Spain Photography & Slow Living Retreats on localmilkretreats.com... I look forward to meeting those of you who join us! #theartofslowliving",

We're apartment hunting in Paris & renting our little home on Airbnb if we can find a place to rent. And all the while I'm wondering what on earth is home to me. When asked where I feel at home most my answer is \"everywhere, no where\". I can't decide where we want to put down roots. Where I am is always my favorite place to be except, oddly, my home town. Its a beautiful place and the people I love most in the world live there, my family. But when I imagine Eulalie growing up, I have to admit to myself that I don't imagine it being there. Maybe one day, who knows, but not now. I've grown comfortable with the idea, instead, of bouncing between Japan, France, and Tennessee each year and not worrying about where home is. Instead I want to focus on who home is: @matthewlud & my Eulalie. #localmilkathome #theartofslowliving",

We partnered with @mothermag & @amazonkitchen to bring you picks for the gardener, the cook, and the artist plus a (very long!) interview over on Mother & photos of Eula and I messing around at home and baking a quick raspberry rose buttermilk cake (along with the recipe!) It will be my first Mother's Day with a baby. Last year I was pregnant, and it was liminal. This year I'm all in, up to my neck, in motherhood. And it's wonderful and endless and totally doable but definitely exhausting. Eula is becoming a little girl at break neck speed, and I can hardly keep up. She's a little nomad tagging along with me to boisterous yakitori bars & making friends with school girls on the Tokyo metro. She's our people. Here's to you, moms. #partner #mothersday #giftguide",

To stand beneath that low ceiling in the cool of clay walls in one of the places where the inception of wabi-sabi happened...I'm actually not easily moved. And it was moving. This trip is when we truly fell in love with Kyoto. We'll be back for the entire month of October, and experimenting with Japanese ingredients in a quiet neighborhood is largely why. Japan is one of those counties where I know I'll always be outside looking in. And that's ok. Better than ok. It's peaceful to be on the outside. And it feels really special when people welcome you in spite of it. Eula has been met with nothing but love, and I'm simply not ready to leave in a week. #localmilkabroad",

      "description": "If peace were a place it would be @stardust_kana's caf√© & shop of lovingly curated home goods, tea, and linen clothing. @thedenizenco and I hosted a one day workshop here today & Kana prepared a bright vegan meal & delicate raw cakes scented with tea and rose petals. She greeted us with indigo leaf tea, and the day was spent taking and styling photos in this immaculate space. This was my first translated workshop (thanks to @thedenizenco who, aside from being one of the most inspiring photographers I know, is also the woman that's opened up the language barrier in Japan for me year after year). We had a group of wonderful (and talented) women, and I could not be more grateful for a day well spent in such good company. If you're ever in Kyoto, don't miss @stardust_kana. And if you love photography, don't miss @thedenizenco's feed. So grateful for amazing women like them. #localmilkretreat #theartofslowliving",

I'm doing research for an updated + extended travel guide to Kyoto...if you have any favorite shops, eateries, temples, gardens, parks, photography spots, or other hidden gems please let me know! Ceramics, clothing, home goods, and gardens are especially on the radar. Looking for the best of the best as well as hidden gems & secret spots. Tonight I'm headed to one of my all time favorites, @yoshihiroimai's Monk, for a dinner date with my one and only, @matthewlud.

Add some classic (and admittedly addictive) garlic & herb @BoursinCheese and you have a perfectly respectable cheese plate. I keep dried dates (they're my candy), marcona almonds (so salty, so good), and rainy day ros√© on hand so I'm never left snackless when impromptu guests arrive. Or you know, I just get hungry. #madetowow #boursincheese #ad",

Flutter in every breeze with the willow branches. And the flowers are dying and the trees are becoming and life and life and spring. I missed Kyoto. Temple gardens tomorrow and an early morning and water, hot, with lemon. #localmilkabroad #theartofslowliving",

Though I can't say I've ever had a bike quite as charming as this little pink number that lives in St. Luke's Mews in London. With more people in the world than ever‚Äîovercrowding in big cities and global gridlock pose serious threats to the environment due to pollution & climate change‚Äîfinding mobility solutions is more important now than ever. I've collaborated with @Ford Smart Mobility to raise awareness of the issues surrounding modern mobility & potential solutions. Their effort is to change the way the world moves, from bike sharing programs and shuttle services to lease sharing programs to electric vehicles. The middle class is predicted to double by 2030, meaning more and more people will want their own cars, creating even more challenges to maintain air quality. Substantial progress has been made in reducing vehicle emissions, but air quality standards remain a challenge in developed nations, and the issue is even more severe in developing nations. So what can we do? We can walk, bike, ride-share, take public transportation, and, when possible, invest in emission reducing vehicles. And most importantly, we can continue the conversation. #ad #FordSmartMobility",
