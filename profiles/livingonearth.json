Inside the bay there are several beaches, most are small and some only exist at low tide. The main one is around 700 feet long with silky soft white sand, underwater colorful coral and exotic fish in exceptionally clear water; the whole bay is one big reef. Maya Bay has become the main tourist attraction of Phi Phi since \"The Beach\" was filmed here in 1999. It was always very popular before the film but now people around the world who haven't even heard of Phi Phi have certainly heard of Maya Bay. The best time to visit Maya Bay is between November and April during the high season when seas are calm and access to the bay is easy. Rough seas from May to October may hinder access but rarely deny entry. The bad news; as it's so beautiful and so well known many boats are required to ferry all the visitors in and out. On any given day at any time there will be 30 + speedboats and longtail boats on the beach, with large ferry boats carrying hundreds of snorkelers and sightseers moored in deeper water. Beautiful it is, secluded it isn't ‚Äì thousands of people visit each day. Try to visit early in the morning or after 5pm and you'll avoid the crowds. Please note that if you enter the bay on your own there is a National Park entry fee of 400 baht (~$10). This cost is included in the price of a tour.",

      "description": "To Sua Ocean Trench, Samoa-‚Ä®Photo by: @tomarcherphoto üí¶\nThis natural swimming pool on a volcanic Samoan island offers visitors the ultimate experience in relaxation.\nTo Sua Ocean Trench, which translates as 'big hole,' is located in Lotofaga village, on the south coast of Upolu island in Samoa. When the volcanoes erupted on the island, much of the ground fell away, and this 98-foot deep hole was the result.\nSteps lead down to a ladder, which tourists can use to descend into the grotto, or use as an impromptu diving board (providing the water levels are high enough).\nFor those less brave, a tumble in from a board a matter of inches above the water may be the safer option.\nThe green landscape is matched by crystal clear waters, an abundance of tropical fish and a sandy bed. A series of canals leading from the pool to the South Pacific Ocean ensure the hole is never dried out.\nIn order to protect the serene spot, as well as maintain the safety of the visitor routes into the water, there is a charge to swim. It will cost adults $15, children $6.00, but is free to those under the age of seven.",

      "description": "Paddle Boarding Havasu Creek, Grand Canyon - Arizona üí¶\nPhoto by: @footloosefotography üåé\nThe Havasupai Reservation is located in one of the most beautiful and remote areas of the western Grand Canyon. The Village of Supai, is located in Havasu Canyon, a southwestern branch of the Grand Canyon, and is accessible only by foot, horseback, or helicopter. The village is the tribal center for the Havasupai Tribe and is noted for its four blue-green waterfalls and camping facilities. Havasupai translates to People-Of-The-Blue-Green-Waters in English. It is an eight mile hike to get to Supai via the Hualapai Trail which leaves from Hualapai Hilltop. This can take from 3 to 6 hours walking or 3 to 5 hours riding, depending upon the physical shape you are in, or how well you ride a horse. You are expected to carry your own food and water (plus camping equipment) and to take your trash back out.",
