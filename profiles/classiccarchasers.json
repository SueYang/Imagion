      "description": "For Sale @LegendaryMotorcar: ’67 Mellow Yellow Vette 👍🏻\n_____________________________________________\n🚘 1967 Chevrolet Corvette L71\n💯 Frame off restoration by Nabor Brothers\n📰 @LegendaryMotorcar\n📸 @ScarfonePhoto\n💵 Offered at $175,000\n📚 Is there anything more American than the Corvette? Nothing can quite make you feel like an Astronaut in the 60s quite like this car. The 1967 Corvette Sting Ray was the last Corvette of the second generation, and five years of refinements made it the best of the line. The 427/435HP L71 Sting Ray would be the high-water mark of Corvette performance and refinement for the C2 series of cars. The rare L71 engine package cost the original buyer an extra $437.10 on the GM order form. This is one of only 8,504 Coupes for the production year that put 22,940 Corvettes on the road. A complete nut and bolt frame off, no expense spared full restoration of this Corvette was completed by marque expert Nabor Brothers of Houston, TX. With the combination of the optional L71 powerhouse engine, the 4-speed close ratio transmission, being a convertible with a factory hardtop, and having a world class complete frame off restoration, plus verified factory original documentation makes this an extremely rare and collectable example.

Raise you paddles 🙋‍♂️ or 🙅‍♂️\n_____________________________________________\n🚘 1987 Lamborghini Countach 5000 QV\n💯 One of only two built with gold interior trim\n📰 @RMSothebys Villa Erba Sale\n📸 @dirk.de.jager\n💵 Estimate: TBA\n📚 This Lamborghini Countach is as good as gold. Literally! Finished new in white over a white leather interior, the car was outfitted with much of its interior trim gold-plated, including the steering column, gated gear shifter and gate, instrument cluster, trunk and engine handles, door sills, and even the exterior badging, as well as exhaust pipe tips. Lamborghini has confirmed that this is one of just two Countaches to ever leave the factory equipped with such eye-catching 80’s opulence. This car was originally delivered to the United States (probably to someone who picked it up wearing a white linen suit and pink V-Neck T-shirt). It was then imported to Japan before eventually being acquired by its current Dutch owner and sent to Lamborghini Polo history for restoration. The car comes complete with all receipts and a certificate from Lamborghini's Polo Historical department confirming the restoration and authenticity of this rare Countach 😎\n_______________________________________________\n#auto #instacar #carporn #autoporn #design #automotive #vintage #drive #classic #classiccar #collect #icon #classiccarchasers #carphotography #forsale #drivetastefully #lamborghini #lambo #countach #modernclassic #italy #japan #usa #dutch #iconic #1980s",

And the car offered here is one of a pair ordered from the factory by two Swiss brothers who must have also thought the same. This estate car originally left the factory as standard left-hand drive V8 in July of 1996 only to return to the factory 2 months later to be modified as a shooting brake. This car's color scheme is British Racing Green with matching upholstery and carpets to the interior, which also features plentiful walnut embellishment. In 1999 this example's engine was rebuilt by the factory and then sold to its second owner, a French art collector who loved and cared for the car until his passing. It was then sold at an auction in Paris in 2014 and has formed part of a significant private collection of Aston Martins. The car comes complete with owner's manual, service book, all tools, jack, first aid kit, battery conditioner, fitted car cover and, most importantly, a fitted humidor! Yes, you read that correctly.

      "description": "CCC's Take: With a top speed of 160 mph, you can go from 0 - to soccer practice in under 7 seconds 👍🏻\n_____________________________________________\n🚘 1996 Aston Martin V8 Sportsman Estate Car\n💯 One of two built for Swiss brothers; 21,000 Kilometers\n📰 @BonhamsMotoring Aston Sale\n📸 @BonhamsMotoring\n💵 Estimate: $380,000 - $450,000\n📚 This 1996 Aston Martin V8 Sportsman Estate Car may cost 10X as much as your average mini-van, but is 50X cooler. And the car offered here is one of a pair ordered from the factory by two Swiss brothers who must have also thought the same. This estate car originally left the factory as standard left-hand drive V8 in July of 1996 only to return to the factory 2 months later to be modified as a shooting brake. This car's color scheme is British Racing Green with matching upholstery and carpets to the interior, which also features plentiful walnut embellishment. In 1999 this example's engine was rebuilt by the factory and then sold to its second owner, a French art collector who loved and cared for the car until his passing. It was then sold at an auction in Paris in 2014 and has formed part of a significant private collection of Aston Martins. The car comes complete with owner's manual, service book, all tools, jack, first aid kit, battery conditioner, fitted car cover and, most importantly, a fitted humidor! Yes, you read that correctly.

It was a grand gesture and the final flowering in France of the great tradition of the truly custom motor car. The chassis was built to carry coachwork that was the latest in grand style and luxury. The concept was outrageously exclusive and something for the very few – not just because of its price, which was stratospheric, or its limited practicality, which was irrelevant. This was a car that was chic, ritzy, aristocratic, and sharp as a knife all at once. The Grand Sport remained very rare. A maximum of 29 were built on the short wheelbase; 26 cars exist today, all with individually coachbuilt bodies.The subject car embarked upon a decade-long mechanical and cosmetic restoration to the highest concours standards, including the original Hermés interior and luggage, which has been expertly restored.  Any Talbot-Lago T26 Grand Sport is a very rare and exciting sports car. In addition, chassis 110121 is a unique one-off cabriolet of great and tasteful beauty, as evidenced by its unparalleled period history at the Paris Salons and French concours. It is a compelling and unprecedented combination 😎\n_______________________________________________\n#auto #instacar #carporn #autoporn #design #automotive #vintage #drive #classic #classiccar#collect #icon #classiccarchasers #carphotography #forsale #drivetastefully #coachbuilt #gentleman #luxury #speed",
