      "description": "\"When another person makes you suffer, it is because he is suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over.\" -Thinh Nhat Hanh . \nThe loop of abuse. As sufferings souls it is not only important to have compassion for others suffering but to take responsibility for our own suffering. I'll say it again... TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OWN SUFFERING. That is the biggest \"I'm sorry\" you could give to those you hurt (hurt people, hurt people). DO SOMETHING about you're suffering so that you can stop hurting others and yourself. Stop blaming other for the unresolved in you. Stop victimizing. Stop denying. Stop excusing. Stop seeking the addiction/bandaid. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY & seek help instead. Seeking help is the most courageous thing you could/will ever do. End the cycle. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.",

      "description": "What if you lived a life with no fucks given. You just did what you wanted to do, when you wanted to do it, without a need to explain yourself to anyone. This is the journey I'm on. I've always lived with a 'fuck it' attitude but I've always followed it up with a need to explain myself or give someone else an explanation. Problem is, the explanation always made me feel I owed someone something or I felt guilty or responsible for that something or someone, therefore counter acting on the initial intention of my 'fuck it' attitude. These days I'm living solely off MY truth. The truth the lives in me unapologetically, without a need for an explanation (even to myself). It's my most bold & vulnerable tool yet towards self love & self exploration & i am embracing it with everything I got! Excited what the universe will present under this new found state of being. Have you ever considered how your life would be different if you lived in this mind set??? #fuckit #nofucksgiven #livefree #beyoutiful #movementtherapy #welcometothenewCuchira #iplaybymyrules #freedom #thisiswhereimAt #noapologies #newPerspective #newExploration #itsMyTime #intentionIsKey",

      "description": "In the past 6 months the most unexpected changes occurred (intensely, not pretty & uninvited) in ways I never saw coming. If someone would've told me my life was gonna take this quick turn I wouldn't have believed them but what a blessings these lists of painful events have turned out to be (or at least that's how I'm choosing to look at it.) The stages of healing through process (LOTS OF PROCESS!) & acceptance have brought out things in me I never knew I had. My creative mind has been unstoppable. The warrior in me has found a peaceful fighter (which for me is new & interesting to observe). My divine feminine being has embraced her womanhood more than ever. My self worth & self love have shown it's light brighter than ever. My curiosity for life has soared with interest & intrigue! My teachings have evolved & have found new inspiration that I didn't even know I had within me. I could really go on & on in every aspect of my life. If we choose to embrace pain (suffering) without dwelling on it, it can be a very powerful tool towards transformation. The key is to let it go when it no longer serves us; when we've learned the lessons it has come to share. I can't say my pain is entirely gone yet, but what I can say is that I'm grateful for the visit, even if Mr. Pain did come uninvited, unexpected & over stayed his welcome. But I admit, I did need him. I didn't necessarily miss him but he came when he knew I was ready & gave me a swift kick in the ass üòÇüôå. A hard one! üòÇDidn't feel very good, but it sure woke me up! I'm awake now. Let's play world! PHOTO BY @morganpierrephotography",

      "description": "European tour has come to an end... Closing thoughts or opening thoughts (you decide). Like is a collection of chapters to the books we write, this European tour was another chapter in my book of experiences that has brought greater depth into my stories of love, laughter, grief, anger, pain, sadness, lust, desire, happiness, passion... the list of emotions goes on & on. To feel is such a magnificent gift. When explored with curiosity, expressed into art & shared amongst others with curiosity & acceptance it can enrich our lives in the most unexpected ways. Only when vulnerable enough to explore our complexities can we write our stories that will take us into other dimensions & leave the greater essence of us behind for others to dance on with. Traveling throughout Europe guiding my fellow warriors through my movement therapy techniques for the past month has made my novel that much richer. This journey came at a time in my life when I was in my deepest state of grief. I can most honestly say that the love, truth & acceptance that was shared in my classes has made my heart explode with hope & passion! I look forward to continuing to spread the love for seeking further within through movement & breath (just to be clear I teach MOVEMENT THERAPY classes using dance, yoga & all sort movement influences. All my classes are ALL LEVELS & for anyone 18 yrs of age & up. Please come with no expectations & full acceptance that you might discover something new within). If any of the beautiful souls that I've crossed along the way would like to write me, I always check my DM. Any studios who would like to host me around the world & bring me out please email me at yogancetherapy@gmail.com ***YOGANCE.COM will be updated in the next few days with my latest workshops. For now refer to my IG stories or past captions for what's coming up üòä (NYC, DC, MD. CA. LA, La Jolla, Michigan, Toronto, JAPAN).

      "description": "Sharing space - \nThis morning I was at a cafe. The cafe layout: a very long booth bench that wraps around the walls of the space. 10 tables. Plenty of seating. Older man sits down at the table next to me. Pulls out the morning paper to accompany his morning dose of caffeine. Once settled another man approaches in an angry tone & says \"this is MY table. See that's MY water\", & points to a glass. Older gentlemen says sorry, gets up slowly, shaking as he grabs his cappuccino & paper. Cafe is \"full\", all tables are taken but still plenty of seating. I offer the man to share \"my\" table. He kindly accepts. Plenty of space for everyone. ‚Ä¢\nI do 'sharing space' exercises often in my classes. They without a doubt are everyone least favorite which is why I insist on doing them. Sharing space puts many people in discomfort, especially when it's so close we are forced to physically touch & connect through eye contact. \"What you want me to touch a stranger?\" We're not strangers. We share humanity in common which energetically connects us. We're all in this together but you can't imagine the sour reaction I often get. If you can't learn to share space gracefully, hopefully you have enough money to buy yourself another planet, cause I don't think 7.5 billion are going anywhere anytime soon üòÇ. Gotta practice loving each other & our #beYOUtiful differences. #Onelove #movementtherapy",

      "description": "Upon waking up my morning thoughts have gone from \"this can't be real, I need to lay here a bit longer\" to \"another day of battle, get your ass up & let's fight!\" The spectrum of deep emotions I feel throughout a 24hr period is absolute insanity & sometimes I feel just that... insane. Gloriously insane, why so? Because I am so damn proud of myself. Proud that I'm refusing to give up & indulge in my grief (even though respecting its importance & place in the healing process). Proud because I am observing myself w/ compassion & calm like I've never quite been able to before. Life will throw us curve balls left & right, it's not about dodging them (in my humble opinion) I prefer to let them hit me straight in the face so I can LEARN more about myself. It's the only way to learn how to catch them balls like a pro next time (no pun intended üòÇ #SingleWomanissues ). Running away from feelings & pretending they don't exist will come back to haunt us even harder. If we stuff our feelings away without resolution, acceptance & understanding, instead of one curve ball,  prepare for an army of them to come at you even harder. So yeah, I'm feeling, it ain't always pretty or fun, but I'm CHOOSING to battle through with self love & courage because I believe I'm worth the fight... and so are you. #AFriendlyReminder #movementismedicine #movementtherapy #beyoutiful #onelove #movementtherapy #feelings #acceptance #selflove #mindmovement",

      "description": "Yesterday's class in Paris was my favorite class I've taught. I didn't teach a sequence/flow. The lesson was much more powerful than a fancy pose could ever be. I taught what my personal practice has been about the past 5 months. Those that did the 'yoga' understood it & felt it's power. The class was about LISTENING & CONNECTING (w/ touch, breath, body, soul & a deep quiet awareness). I believe LISTENING & CONNECTING is what's lacking most in our world today especially in big cities. We don't take the time to practice it because most of us are in such a hurry to feed the ego & EXPECTATIONS of what we WANT, that we miss the importance of what IS; the details, the ever present, ever changing NOW. The humility it takes to allow ourselves to REALLY pay attention (without entertaining) is incredibly life changing & demanding. For the most part I find people are quick to not like these teachings. They get flustered, irritated & are quick to judge that they just want to dance & sweat \"like me\". I DON'T DANCE & SWEAT; that's the superficial appearance of what I do & clearly missing the entire intention of my life's work. My practice is ALL about listening & answering, rooting & rising, awareness & breath, empowering strength tied in w/delicate subtleties, waiting & responding, questioning, constantly toying w/ mind discomfort. I discover these aspects of myself through MANY techniques. The last thing my practice is about is a handstand or sweaty workout (but if you working deep & internal enough you'll sweat just breathing). My teachings/practice are about being TRUE to myself & my students EACH & EVERY MOMENT, not to entertain. That's what I share generously in my work & hope people will pick up on. MOVEMENT medicine, mediation, therapy... mind movement. Be aware not to judge a book by it's cover cause if you do, you'll miss the most important lessons in life, the ones that really matter. #movementtherapy #beyoutiful #movewithoutapology",

      "description": "This is my last week of the European movement therapy tour. Although I still have 3 cities to go (Paris TONIGHT @healthywarriorsparis , London & Brussels) it's slowly coming to an end.I have many thoughts & things I learned on this journey but I'll save all that for the wrap up. I'm finding that with just 1 week left emotions are running rapid through me yet again. My life has seen dramatic change in the past 5 months due to surprising events (hey that's life!). These events brought severe rapid change. When life surprises us we can either choose to dwell in the memories of what was or we can CHOOSE TO ACCEPT & take life by the balls (of which I'm open for the universe to bring me in human form as well #JustSayin üòÇ). I mourned the loss of a 13 yr relationship for 2 months. Wept like a baby, screamed uncontrollably & felt intense pain. Month 3 I decided to empower myself. YES A BOLD SOLID CHOICE! I went into this tour ready to explore myself on my own, independent, in a way I haven't known for over 20 yrs. First week was rough, not gonna lie but as time passed & I opened up to all the beauty our world has to offer, the beYOUtiful people I've met along the way, the stories they shared. You guys have reminded me how glorious life is in all its twists & turns. Last week in, I know big change looks ahead yet again. Yes I'm scared but I'm also in complete & utter awe of what life may bring me next. So universe, I come at you with an open heart. I'm listening & readyüòä #movewithoutapology #movementtherapy #movementismedicine #movementartist #beyoutiful #onelove",

      "description": "I was told today that I am so fortunate to feel my feelings so profoundly. What a beautiful sentiment. I've always felt that feeling was such a great gift, even if it's hard sometimes. Feelings gives us colors, helps us grow, be grateful, connect on a deeper level with others & ourselves. I've never been one to run away from feelings. I invite them in happily, all of them, the whole damn familia üòÇ, the good, bad & ugly, it's all a part of me & I refuse to apologize for any of them. Yes, I ask a lot of questions of myself, I think a lot about what I'm feeling, why I'm feeling that way, I dissect & research my emotions & thoughts profoundly. I interest me, because if I don't find my feelings fascinating enough to explore further how will anyone else truly be able to connect with my soul. I search for profound relationships & connections, so I allow myself to be vulnerable in order to invite those deep connections into my life & have greater understanding. Some find me complicated, an over thinker. I don't think I'm an over thinker at all. I'm just aware & vulnerable enough to explore with curiosity & refuse to imprison my heart & soul to make others comfortable. When I pass on I want to know that I dove into every part of my being even if at times scary & not just sat in the comfortable places of my heart. I love to surround myself with others that do the same, that push past fear to know themselves just that much better. And yes... I will use every tool possible to continue to search deeper & if that makes it uncomfortable or difficult for others, then maybe we weren't meant to explore together for now. One love.

This morning was that for me. After having an incredible week emotionally of mostly positive feelings, today I woke up sad, the past haunting me. I had a chat with my best friend @cglur . Her friendship is abundantly generous without being overbearing. Patient, compassionate, detailed in its subtle approaches & incredibly truthful & heartfelt in compassion. Today after we spoke I cried. Not tears of sadness but tears of complete & utter gratitude for this human, this friendship, this trust, this selflessness, this reminder of how lucky I am to have a sister that will pick me up when I fall. I cried because I felt grateful to be able to feel grateful even after all that's happened... all the pain. I am grateful on the deepest level I've ever felt in my life, in the hardest moment of my life. #grateful #movementartist #movewithoutapology #movementismedicine #movementtherapy #onelove #truth #friendship #beyoutiful",
