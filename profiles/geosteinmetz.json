      "description": "Photograph by George Steinmetz @geosteinmetz  This is Leonard Knight, a visionary outsider artist that I met in 1988 during a trip through the Southern California desert.  Leonard was using discarded house paints to color Salvation Mountain, a monumental bas-relief earth sculpture, and was living in the dead truck you see in the background. On this day someone had just donated a scooter to him to transport water from a nearby irrigation canal to mix with the mud and straw for his adobe monument to God.  Leonard taught me the value of sticking with an idea, even if it was a little whacky, as over time it could develop into something substantial.  That fixity of purpose has informed everything I’ve done since: from my 15 year project to photograph all of the world's deserts, to my current @FeedThePlanet project to document the effect of large scale agriculture on the natural world.  To see what Leonard’s work became, check out #LeonardKnight which will lead you to the work of my friend Aaron Huey @argonautphoto, who did an entire book about Leonard in his last years. Leonard’s spirit lives on!",

      "description": "Photograph by George Steinmetz @geosteinmetz  Truck drivers wait for the rain to stop in the shelter of a combine harvester just west of Sinop, Brazil.  This area of the Amazon is a transition zone from tropical rainforest to savannah that is rapidly being converted into large scale farms that harvest soybeans in Jan/Feb and corn in May/June.  The double harvest is possible due to fertile soil that requires no irrigation. As more natural land is put under the plow, Brazil has become one of the fastest growing agricultural exporters in the world.  To see more of where our food comes from, follow @feedtheplanet",

      "description": "Photograph by George Steinmetz @geosteinmetz  Last week I was honored to win the Environmental Vision Award from the Pictures of the Year competition.  I never thought of myself as an environmentalist, but I guess that’s what happens when you poke around and tell people what you are seeing.  The picture above was taken during the soybean harvest in the southern Amazon, where increasing demand for soybeans (primarily in China) is making it profitable to clear cut tropical forest.  With a climate that allows two harvests of soybeans per year without irrigation, large scale farms in Mato Grosso province are rapidly converting virgin rainforest to farmland.
