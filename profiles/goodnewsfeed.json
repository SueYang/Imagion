      "description": "This post is specifically for those of you who are believing the lie that your life has no purpose. It's also for those who are believing, for whatever reason, that you are of no value. Let me speak truth into your life right now. YOU were made on purpose for a purpose. The Almighty God thoughtfully and deliberately created you in love. He spent time on the details that make you one-of-a-kind. That makes you extremely valuable to Him. Not only did He make you purposefully but he made you to have purpose. God has specific visions for each one of us.\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\nüî∏Purposely Made + Given Purpose = Valueüî∏\n\nYou are of great worth because of our Creator.\n\n#GoodNewsFeed\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\n‚ÄúO LORD, You have searched me and known me. You know when I sit down and when I rise up; You understand my thought from afar. You scrutinize my path and my lying down, And are intimately acquainted with all my ways. Even before there is a word on my tongue, Behold, O LORD, You know it all. You have enclosed me behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is too high, I cannot attain to it. Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? If I ascend to heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, Even there Your hand will lead me, And Your right hand will lay hold of me. If I say, \"Surely the darkness will overwhelm me, And the light around me will be night,\" Even the darkness is not dark to You, And the night is as bright as the day. Darkness and light are alike to You. For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb. I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Your works, And my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth; Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Your book were all written The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them. How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them! If I should count them...",

We fully believe that the Lord is reliable and effective in all areas of our lives. We serve an all-powerful God, the same God that parted the Red Sea. Why would we lean on our own understanding when we can tap into this power source?\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\nIn everything we do, let‚Äôs make known the importance of our God to those around us. It is important to give Him glory in everything, the big and small. If it‚Äôs making a PB&J sandwich for your child‚Äôs lunch or just landing your biggest business deal yet, acknowledge God and His goodness. Let others see Whom you serve.\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\nIf you do this, ‚ÄúHe will make your paths straight.‚Äù A straight path is effective. It gets you where you need to be the quickest. God wants you to get to where you need to be, whether this is with your family, in school or in business. We can try to do it on our own, but it will be a curvy road. We may be constantly moving but not making progress. Not until we lean on His understanding and guidance, will we have a straight path and make it to where we need to be.\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\nWhat do you need to trust the Lord with? What haven‚Äôt you given completely over to God? Are you acknowledging Him along the way or are you patting yourself on the back?\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\n\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.\" Proverbs 3: 5-6 NASB",
