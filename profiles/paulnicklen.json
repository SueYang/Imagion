Here, a candy-striped shrimp enjoys the benefits of its symbiotic relationship with the crimson anemone. The shrimp cleans the surrounding area while the anemone protects the shrimp from predators. Just more proof that working together is better than fighting each other.

      "description": "In cold Antarctic seas, a humpback surfaces with a mouthful of krill, squeezing the water out of over 600 baleen plates that act as a filter. The humpback is an incredible comeback story. Hunted nearly to extinction, the humpback was placed on the endangered list on 1970, and then protected further by an international whaling moratorium in 1982. The highly intelligent species is on the comeback trail, and the conservation community should be celebrating, while also doubling down on protection for all ocean species. *\n*\n*\n*\n#antarctica #nature #naturelovers #instagood #photooftheday #beautiful #cute #happy #followme #picoftheday #fun #smile #art #nofilter #amazing #beauty #photo #cool #instagram #instacool #love #gratitude #humbledbynature",

      "description": "Words by @craigwelch // Ice in Antarctica never stops being magical. Ninety percent of an iceberg is usually under water, and this frozen freshwater typically melts faster below the surface of the sea than above. Sometimes during this process, as the melting freshwater rises in the ocean it breaks into plumes, like rising thunderheads, mixing in more warm water. That melts channels in the sides of icebergs, creating seams, like ribs, in the underwater portion of the iceberg, says Richard Alley, a Penn State geologist and ice expert. When sunshine and warm air melt ice above the surface, the iceberg slowly rises, exposing these achingly beautiful vertical flutes, which we saw during our journey along the western Antarctic Peninsula.

      "description": "Very soon (Earth Day), I will be opening my first ever, fine art gallery in New York City. It's a lifelong dream to have a gallery of my own in a place where my message of art, purpose and adventure can resonate around the globe.  Most importantly, I will be having visiting artists with a similar passion for making a difference with their photography.  NYC is that place to make this happen.  Please stay tuned for information on the gallery opening. I'll be there. I hope to see you there on April 22nd at 347 West Broadway, NYC.  This print of an adult king penguin looking for their chick on the island of South Georgia, Antarctica will be represented at the gallery  #dreamsdocometrue #artscienceconservation #nature #naturelovers #gallery #fineart",

      "description": "Through dancing sun rays, a mother humpback whale hovers motionless just above a coral head on the Silver Bank of the #DominicanRepublic.  Calves can hold their breaths for only a few minutes at a time while mothers rest in the open water column for much longer.  She needs to save her energy as she does not feed herself at this time of year even though she nurses her calf with milk that has ten times the fat content of  humans.

      "description": "An adult female humpback whale leaves her awaiting calf below the surface as she launches her 80,000 pound body skyward in an impressive show of power, grace and acrobatics.  No one knows why humpback whales breach and no one knows why they sometimes breach over and over.  What an impressive show as the 25 knot winds peeled hundreds of gallons of seawater from her spinning body.  What we do know is that after we drove them almost to the verge of extinction, these amazing marine mammals have made a remarkable comeback.  Now that is a great reason to jump for joy! *\n*\n*\n*\n*\nWith @Sea_Legacy, @_Aquaticadventures, @cristinamittermeier, @aquaticadventures #silverbank #humpback #whale #@ocean\n#joy #love #respectnature #aquaticadventures",
