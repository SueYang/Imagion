Not sure what we'll be having for breakfast yet 😜 but here's some absolutely yummy protein pancakes for you...thank you to my friends @nutristrength for sending me their delicious vanilla protein powder! 🙈\nThey're super simple to make (1/2 cup buckwheat flour, 1 scoop @nutristrength vanilla protein powder, 1 tsp cinnamon, handful sliced  blueberries & 1 cup of water or almond milk) - Mix and spoon onto a frying pan - when they bubble - flip! \nI topped with coconut yogurt & toasted almonds. Very very tasty guys! 😍\nI hope you have a lovely Sunday, we'll be exploring and mostly eating - I'll pop some stuff in stories later! 😜\nLove Niki xx\n#sunday #pancakes #proteinpancakes #sponsored #delicious #wellness #organic #foodphotography #foodandwine #Foods4Thought #foodstyling #eatmoreplants #vegan #onmyplate #whatveganseat #wellbeing #veganfood #veganfoodporn #plantpower #foodie #food",
