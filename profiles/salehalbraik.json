      "description": "IT'S MY 29th BIRTHDAY! And it's the reason why I need a break from Social Media.\n\n___\n\nFor the past 10 years, I have exposed my entire life to Social Media. Everyone knew what I loved to do, what I loved to eat, my family outings, my friends, my work. I have given the internet my ALL.\n\n___\n\nI have been applauded for my work, and I have also been scrutinized for it. I have been loved, I have been hated. I was honest, but I was also no fool to the fact that Social Media was an addiction.\n\n___\n\nI decided to take a break from Social Media to reconnect with myself. Nothing major has happened, and I am well. I just have to do this for me.\n\n___\n\nThank you for the birthday wishes. I'll see you soon.\n\n___",

As she picked up her paintball gun, her response was ready, until her eyes met his. \"Loser buys the other a pretzel at Dawn\", she smiled, putting her head gear on. \"I'll look forward to having you buy me one\", he smiled, and put on his head gear. The clock had struck midnight at @WaltDisneyWorld, and everyone began running in different directions. Winner gets a years VIP pass at the park, and this year was hers. The hundreds of people scattered across the park, as she kneeled behind one of the Disney castles bushes. The sound of Mickey's battle horn was heard, she closed her eyes. And ran. \n___\n\nHours into the night, the numbers of participants dwindled, as the total number left was displayed on the castle in the middle of the Park. \"Three\", she whispered, her heart beating fast. All of a sudden she heard a paintball shot from behind her, and saw that 'he' shot someone who was about to shoot her. \"Saved you\", he shouted from afar. The number '2' indicated that they were the only ones left. \"Now what?\", he yelled. She aimed the paintball gun at him, and so did he at her. \"THREE\", she yelled. He realized what she was doing, and so he yelled back, \"TWO\". She closed her eyes, \"ONE\". And the shots were fired at the both of them. They both won that night, as it was a tie, but more importantly, they both bought the other a pretzel. End scene.\n\n___\n\nCatch my vacation on Insta Story and Snapchat on @SalehAlBraik üëª.

His father, the King, stared down at them both. She turned around, in her canary gown, and bowed immediately. \"Your highness\", she said, tilting her head slightly. \"Dance with me\", he kneeled down to grab her hands and slowly got up with her. The King eyed the two of them, displeased with her. \"I'm sorry\", she turned to walk away. \"You must remember\", he begged her, taking a step forward. \"I told you, I can't, I don't know you\", she said, walking away. He quickly realized this may be the last time he saw her, and so he quickly went around her. \"Dance with me\", he let out his hand and bowed, \"Please\". She quickly took his hand, out of shock that a prince would bow to her. \"Alright\", she whispered.\n\n___\n\nThe violins began, and his hand slid around her waist. One foot after the other, and on the ballroom floor they danced. She looked him in the eye, as the slowly spun, and her heart fluttered. His legs leading hers, as he twirled her once, her stomach had butterflies. Their pace got quicker, as all of his guests left the dance floor to look at them. It was a sight of pure chemistry, movement in its finest. As he dipped her, and picked her up again, her head rested on his shoulder. His smell was intense, and in that instant, it all came rushing back. \"I remember\", she said with a smile, and so did he. Her smile quickly faded when she remembered who tried to hurt her, and what caused her amnesia. One look at him, and he knew she remembered. The King.

She felt she was being strangled by the dress, this wasn't her. A boy caught her eye, to which he bowed his head as he raised his glass. She rolled her eyes, that was it. A moment later she snuck behind the stage and plugged in her iPhone, and changed the tracks. He saw what she did, and smirked. She was in the middle of the dance floor, her parents in shock. Girls left their partners in the middle of their Waltz, and began grabbing drinks and danced with her. Parents across the courtyard began whispering, as her father felt the most ashamed.\n\n___\n\nShe felt the music pass through her, as more of her generation joined her on the dance floor. All of a sudden, the music had stopped. Her father approached her, \"This isn't who your supposed be\", he said. Her eyes connected with the handsome boy that smiled at her before, as he ran past her and her father, and jumped off the dock and into the water. \"That's because you never took time to know me,\" she said, taking off her shoes. As if in slow motion, she turned around, and RAN. Her generation behind her, as they rushed passed the dance floor, on to the deck, as the sun kissed the horizon, and JUMPED. Her eyes, met his. They were free. End scene.\n\n___\n\nCatch my vacation on Insta Story and Snapchat on @SalehAlBraik üëª. Currently in LUGANO. #FearlessinSwitzerland\n\n___",

Her Chanel suit, with glasses to match, you could hear her heels from the echo of the glass and iron roof. On the corner of her left, she saw one. On her right, another two. She noticed the entire space was emptier than usual, and she saw people being evacuated from the other side. She reached the middle, and dropped her clutch. As she bent to pick it up, the three men approached her from behind. Kicking one from the back, as she grabbed another's arm, held his gun, and knocked the other with his elbow. \"STOP\", she heard from behind. As she stood above the three unconscious agents, she turned to face 'him'. Their eyes connected.\n\n___\n\nSilence as for the next sixty seconds, it was just the two of them. Their guns pointing at each-other. \"Don't do this\", he whispered. She could hear the sirens, and her eyes began to tear. All she remembered was Cuba, with him. \"Put the gun down\", he said. She slowly raised her gun towards the sky, and he sighed. The next moment, she fired the gun. He covered his head, as the pieces of glass fell. He then looked up, and so her being lifted by a rope to a helicopter. He aimed his gun at her, but couldn't do it. As she got away, he caught a note that she dropped. She may have gotten away from the law, but she was still his. All the letter said was, 'Cuba'. He booked his flight.

There are people I pushed away, but some I admittedly let go. Sometimes I get these moments where flashes of memories come back, and I remember the good times. I wish them well, until this very day. But it makes me think. There was a point when those people came into our lives where we didn't see an end coming so soon. And now my question comes to you guys. If you knew someone in your life had an expiration date on your friendship, would you still be their friend? Would you still invest your time? Knowing that you will make amazing memories in the present, but they won't be a part of your future. Don't forget, with good memories also comes bad ones.

They came out with a reception of applause and flashes of lights. The bride got on the carriage and tossed the bouquet, with girls jumping to catch it. He signaled his horse, and the carriage made its way. Under the tall trees of Central Park, he smiled as he saw the couple in eachother's embrace. He knew a special route under the cherry blossom trees that was magical. He wanted them to have a beginning worth remembering. His job was simple, but he took it to heart. A marriage was the start to a journey, and he was the start of it.\n\n___\n\nAs the afternoon came, he took his now-empty carriage down his usual path. He pulled slightly so the horse knew to stop. Entering the cemetery, his path made his way to her gravestone. Kneeling down with a small bouquet of roses, he said a little prayer. She had passed away the week before their marriage, and he had never married since. Now that years have passed, he has found some peace in the fact that it was meant to be. While they never had a beginning, he could at least ensure someone else has one they'd remember forever. End scene.\n\n___",

They were seated at a table near the couple they were standing behind at the entrance line. They looked at the little boy, as his eyes lit up when he saw coloring paper and crayons on the restaurants table.\n\n___\n\nAs they waited for their food to arrive, he watched his son try to color.

The couple noticed that he wasn't coloring, but instead using each color and simply stroking lines. \"Hi, we didn't want to interrupt\", the couple said in pity, \"but maybe you should see someone about your son\". The father smiled, and turned to whisper to them. \"My son just had a procedure done,\" he looked back at his son, \"He can now see for the first time in his life\". Their food arrived, and as the couple backed up in shame, he smiled at his son who's eyes lit up when he saw the colorful food in front of him. Never judge a book by its cover, or a person by your assumption. End scene.\n\n___",

After doing so, she realized she was falling for him. \"I need to show you something\", she said, walking him inside. They sat opposite each-other on the living room floor, as she got closer and held his hand. \"You know I care about you\", her eyes on the floor, \"a lot actually\". He grabbed her hands, \"I care about you a lot too\", he replied, smiling. \"But there's something you need to know about me\", she said, her eyes slowly focused on his, she was afraid he'd think she was weird. In that moment all he could focus on was her eyes, and her eyes alone. He realized that he had already fallen for her. \"I need you to close your eyes\", she whispered. \"Alright\", he whispered.\n\n___\n\nHer heart was beating faster than ever before, \"Open them\", she whispered. As he did, he noticed they were both floating off the ground slightly. He didn't panic, and instead looked at her and smiled. As they slowly touched the floor again, he didn't say anything and got up and walked away. Her heart sank, until she saw him coming back with a book from her shelf. \"I need you to close your eyes\", he whispered. He took her hand and placed it on the book with his. \"Open them\", he whispered. As she did, the book opened, and out came hundreds of butterflies. Her eyes teared up as they filled the house. She wasn't alone. He may be weird, but he was her kind of weird. End scene.\n\n___\n\nCatch my vacation on Insta Story and Snapchat on @SalehAlBraik üëª.

And it hit me, how a few simple words can change someone's entire day, or even longer. Never underestimate how long words can stay with someone during the course of their life. Sometimes that's all we're left with, after a friendship or a relationship is over. So today I'm going to make an initiative to say something beautiful about the people in my life. Just so that I can see them smile. A few minutes of my time to make someone that I love feel good? Sounds like something we can all do. Spread the love people, we need it now more than ever. When was the last time you said you loved someone? So let's start. I love you guys.\n\n___\n\nCatch my vacation on Insta Story and Snapchat on @SalehAlBraik üëª.

She was lucky enough to have her husband by her side today, to experience it in a whole new perspective. As they walked, kids ran across the street with their own favorite princess gowns and tiaras. She looked up at him and giggled, and squeezed his arm from excitement. \"Congratulations\", one of the Disney staff told them, when noticing their 'Anniversary' pins on their shirt. It's been three amazing years together, and each year she realized how much more in love she was with him. A parade began taking place, and they waited on the sideline to see who was coming.\n\n___\n\nHe noticed kids trying to peak through people, as they couldn't see the parade. He lifted them one by one, placing them on a side bench to stand on so that they could see. She smiled, he would be a perfect father. As Mickey came out of the parade, he quickly took out his camera and asked someone to take a picture of them both. He smiled and thanked the stranger and showed her the picture. It was perfect, in every way possible. It was also the first picture of the 'three' of them. She held on to her tummy, and looked at him carrying one of the kids on his shoulder. Maybe she'll tell him after 'Space Mountain'. End scene.\n\n___\n\nCatch my vacation on Insta Story and Snapchat on @SalehAlBraik üëª.

It's not our fault, nor does it make us bad people for doing so. It's just that we've been blessed in different ways that we don't realize them because they're always with us. So let's take a second. I want you guys to do an exercise with me. Take a minute out of your day, or just a few seconds if you really don't have time, and tell me what you're thankful for. Write it down! I want to hear them. Inspire people around the world to know what YOU are thankful for, so maybe they'll be thankful about it too. SO, what are you thankful for?\n\n___\n\nI am thankful for my sight, my hearing, the ability to move, the laughter I am given on a daily basis.

Obviously it's something we've all thought about. Knowing what the future may hold. Some of us are eager to find out exactly what, while others would rather not know. I envy the people who don't have the need to find out. You could see it in their care-free nature and euphoric soul. I often ask myself about the future before I even start anything. Does that make sense? I'd be the type that would sabotage things just because I see no future in it. Emphasis on \"I see\", and the fact that I'm completely putting a conclusion based on an assumption.\n\n___\n\nIf only there was a crystal ball that we could look into that would be able to tell us where we're headed. Or how much we have to push in order to get to that goal? Is there a finish line? I'm caught up in all of these questions. I wanted to know what you think? Would you rather know your future, or not? Any advice for someone who's looking for answers? Waiting for your thoughts.\n\n___\n\nCatch my vacation on Insta Story and Snapchat on @SalehAlBraik üëª.
