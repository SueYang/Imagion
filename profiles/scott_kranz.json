      "description": "This morning's close-up of Black Tusk, a striking pinnacle of rock and ice dominating the Garibaldi range in British Columbia. I've made it to Whistler this weekend to meet both new and old friends, outstanding photographers, to experiment and field test new cameras from @getolympus. Shot this aerial on the new Micro 4/3 OM-D E-M1 II. Excited to learn more while in this incredible environment. #capturingwhistler",
