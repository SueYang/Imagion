      "description": "Skellig Michael was always one of my favorite places in Europe. Thankfully, I was able to go before Star Wars: The Force Awakens was released.\n\nBefore Star Wars, few people knew about Skellig Michael and demand to visit was rather low. Since then, demand to visit the island has sky rocketed, but the number of available boats and seats hasnâ€™t increased very much. Toss in the regular rain and weather cancelations which are a reality in that part of the Atlantic, and it is now become very difficult to visit.\n\nIf you visit Skellig Michael (which I highly recommend) I suggest booking your trip well in advance, and possibly give yourself an extra day incase the boat is delayed due to weather. Also, even if there isnâ€™t a delay, you will want to prepare for rain which is quite likely.\n\nIf youâ€™ve seen the new trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, there is a whole lot more Skellig Michael, which means it is only going to get more popular, which means you probably need to double down on my advice in 2018.\n\n#Ireland #skellig #skelligmichael #everythingeverywhere #unesco #worldheritage #worldheritragesite",

My first stop was the Big Island of Hawaii where I visited my first world heritage site: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.\n\nOver the last 10 years Iâ€™ve had the pleasure to visit 327 world heritage sites, and Iâ€™ve photographed and documented all of them (although in some cases, there wasnâ€™t a whole lot to photograph). It is hard to pick just one world heritage site as my favorite, and if I gave you an answer it might change depending on my mood.â€¨â€¨However, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong with Petra, especially if you visit Petra at night. Iâ€™ve been there 3 times and Iâ€™d gladly go again.\n\n#worldheritage #unesco #unescoworldheritagesite #worldheritagesite #jordan #petra #whs",

      "description": "Last October I visited the tiny island nation of Tuvalu.\n\nTuvalu is the smallest country which is a member of the United Nations, with a population of less than 10,000. It is also one of the smallest countries in the world by area at only 26 kmÂ².\n\nI spent four days on the Funafuti atoll, which is the capital and most populated island in Tuvalu.â€¨â€¨There isnâ€™t a whole lot to do in Tuvalu. In addition to being tiny, it is also the least visited country in the world. The only way to reasonably get there is by an expensive flight from Fiji, and it is expensive because Air Fiji has a monopoly on the route.â€¨â€¨The airstrip is right in the middle of the island with roads and people going over it all day long. When a plane lands, there is a big production with sirens and trucks to make sure that no one is on the runway.\n\nI took this photo when I rented a scooter one day and drove from one end of the island to the other. This is taken at one of the extreme ends of Funafuti where few people live.\n\n#tuvalu #funafuti #pacific #southpacific #islands #remoteislands",

It is the primary shrine to Inari, which in the Shinto religion is the god of industry, prosperity and success.\n\nThe shine in Kyoto is noteworthy for the hundreds of orange tori, or gates, which line the path up the mountain. The tori are donated by businesses who seek good fortune.\n\nAs the tori are made of wood, they are always being replaced and are always under construction.\n\nThe shrine can be easily visited as there is a Japan Rail station at the base of the mountain. \n#athomeintheworld #awesome_earthpix #awesome_photographers #awesomeearth #awesomeglobe #TLPicks #discoverglobe #earthfocus #earthpix #exploretocreate #fantastic_earth #huffpostgram #ItsAmazingOutThere #livetravelchannel #lonelyplanet #nakedplanet #natgeotravel #ourplanetdaily #travelawesome #travelingourplanet #wonderful_places #bbctravel #japan #kyoto",
