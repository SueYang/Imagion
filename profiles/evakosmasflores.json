      "description": "I love hosting online workshops because it lets people who don’t have the means or the time to be able to travel to one of my 5-day workshops still dive into and learn all about photography, styling, food writing, and branding. It’s difficult if you’re a small business owner or a parent to just drop everything and be gone for nearly a week; my parents had a small Greek deli growing up so I understand the responsibility that comes with managing a small business all on your own (which is something I still do today with my photography business). I’m so happy to be able to teach and get to know more people through my online workshops -  teaching is something that brings me so much joy, I love seeing the “aha!” moment in my students’ work when I can tell that they’re really getting a concept, and watching their skills grow from there. My mother was an elementary school teacher, my sister is a kindergarten teacher, and my brother is an elementary school counselor, so teaching is definitely something that deeply and truly resounds with me and who I am. The spaces for my online workshop are going very quickly, if you’re interested in learning more about photography, styling, writing, and blogging, I’d absolutely love to have you in my course! You can read more about the course material via the link in profile and at www.FirstWeEat.co/online-workshop Hope to \"see\" you there! 😊",
