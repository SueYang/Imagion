      "description": "It's tough when things don't go as you imagine. I didn't think giving birth would be easy, but I never imagined I would still be in pain seven weeks later. My body is having a hard time keeping up with all the new responsibilities and it's taking its toll on my thoughts. Am I doing enough? Doing it well at all? I'm not getting out much (out of bed even), and a part of me can't help but feel powerless and a bit sad I'm not one of those cool mothers walking their baby for hours, baking and having coffee and lunch in caf√©s. I didn't have the energy to snap these lovely flowers from my parents' garden until it was too late. Shout out to all the mothers out there who are worn out, physically and mentally, wearing the same clothes every day and who can't remember the last time they showered - dealing with things one minute at a time. I think we'll be okay, I just don't know when üíõ",

      "description": "I'm the daughter of a refugee from a non western country - in the eyes of the Danish government that now makes me not Danish, despite being born in Denmark and having lived here all 32 years of my life. I'm not exactly sure how I'm supposed to feel about that, and how everyone else affected is supposed to feel. As if I didn't feel rootless enough already, being the child of two different cultures, the one I've identified with the most has now basically cast me out. I can't help but feel that a lot of doors are closing around the world, that too many of us are turning a blind eye and that it's going to have serious consequences for our options of living in peace in the future. Keeping your door shut doesn't just keep people out, it keeps you locked in. So open that door. If you can't be the light then at least let it (and us!) in - don't let fear take you over ‚ú®",
