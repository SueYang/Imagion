The boulders were amazing and the crowd was epic. THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who has supported me on my come back. I was determined to come back stronger and through the help and support of an amazing team of people that was possible. Couldn't have asked for a better way to start the season. ❤😁😝 #thankyou #ifscwc #climbing #competition\n•••",
