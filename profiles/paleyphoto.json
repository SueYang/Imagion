      "description": "Back home after a month in Iran and Portugal and thrilled to find this in the mail! My latest story in National Geographic magazine. Pinch me it’s a dream. Shot alongside my family in Pakistan’s Karakoram mountains (with the tiny Fujifilm #x100t), it was initially an online only feature, but it ended up as well in the magazine... with my text! This is the part that I personally find hard to believe. I have renewed my admiration for writers... what a perilous job it is to juggle words. For the real thing, get a copy of the magazine (April 2017) or see the link in my Instagram profile.",

Here, at a school in the village of Zood Khun, girls play an intense game of cricket during a break. Behind them, a high-altitude trail leads into the Pamir Mountains of Afghanistan. It's an amazing region, very happy to be able to share it. Meanwhile I am off to Iran, to the desert and onward surfing in Portugal. Packing confusion. #girlpower @natgeocreative",

I will be unearthing some mountain power in the next couple of days, before I am off to Iran.\nThe Pamir/Hindukush/Karakoram mountains regions (part of the greater Western Himalayas) in Afghanistan/Pakistan/Tajikistan have been my longest obsession as a photographer. I started “working” there back in 1999/2000, unknowing of where I was going - my beard got white over there and I have happily explored most corners of that region - but then soon enough need to return.\nThis here is a Wakhi household in the lower elevation of the Afghan Pamir; some hectic before food and a young woman showing her ring. My tripod was a plastic drum laying around the kitchen, shot on a Contax 645. In Wakhi language, each part of the house has a specific word for it. This here is by the Dildung - the open hearth. @natgeocreative",
