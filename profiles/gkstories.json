      "description": "Things I learned from our 'Green Kitchen At Home' cooking class at @surlatable in New York today. \n1. I talk way too much. \n2. I take credit for Luise's brilliance at least once every five minutes. \n3. This pilaf salad took a lot longer for our attendees to prepare than we thought it would. \n4. It was apparently still everyone's favorite. \n5. Having three assistants cleaning up your mess is dangerously addictive. \n6. My hand writing is just as ugly as when I signed my very first book. \n7. Our readers are the kindest of people.\n\nThere are only a few spots left for my hands-on cooking class at @surlatable in Los Angeles on Friday May 5th. I've left a link in my profile in case you would like to listen to me ramble about vegetables, cook together and hang out. \nJust 2 days until our book is out in the US!\n#greenkitchenathome",
