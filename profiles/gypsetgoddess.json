      "description": "I've already made solid headway on my spring cleaning around the house, but now I need to spring clean my soul. I'm ready to make some changes. 🙌🏻\n.\nWe can all choose how we want to spend our time, and I've taken stock and found 4 habits that I am making a point to spend less time on from here on out:\n.\n1. I will avoid watching TV during the day.\n2. I will avoid negative conversations about other people, unless they are in a problem solving context.\n3. I will be less reactive to uncomfortable feelings of fear, anger, and sadness.\n4. I will avoid making assumptions about others feelings, opinions, and intentions.\n.\nIn the mission of improving oneself and breaking bad habits, I find it better to add than simply subtract. In place of my old habits I will be doing these things instead:\n.\n1. Spend more time outside.\n2. Spend more time discussing what I love and admire about people I know.\n3. Take more deep breaths and force myself to experience a waiting period before I react.\n4. Communicate when I don't understand someone's behavior, and ask them to clarify.\n.\nThese changes won't necessarily be easy, and won't happen overnight, but I'm determined to be a happier, calmer, less stressed, and more discipline me.\n.\nIf you were to spring clean your soul, what are some changes that you would make? 💗\n.\n.\n.\n📸: @the.walshman",

      "description": "How easily are you offended? When you feel offended, what do you do about it?\n.\nI ask these questions, because as a society, I feel like we're becoming a little too touchy.\n.\nThat's not to say there isn't a ton of offensive stuff going on everyday, because it's all undeniably there, but at the same time it seems that some have started to welcome that feeling of offense, and the temptation towards self-righteousness that often accompanies it.\n.\nI feel like as soon as we combine self-righteousness with a feeling of offense, it becomes dangerous. In this case we run the risk of allowing ourselves to become offended more often, because when we become offended we also get to feel \"right\".\n.\nFeeling \"right\" does feel good. I get it. However this craving to be \"right\" is making a lot of us too quick to point out how others are wrong whenever we get the chance.\n.\nIf we continue this way, does being offended not become like crying wolf?\n.\nInstead of being offended by every little thing that we take personally, can we please take a step back, and save our offense and righteous indignation for situations where it really matters? Each of us must self-regulate, and honestly be our own judge of when this is the case, and when it isn't.\n.\nBeing so easily offended by everything around us doesn't bring us together. It polarizes us, it separates us, it makes us right vs. wrong, it makes us angry, it makes us fight, and it makes us, as a population, easier to control. (Ever heard the phrase \"divide and conquer\"??)\n.\nI'm all about social justice and righteous indignation (keyword: righteous, not superfluous), but otherwise, can we please chill out?\n.\nIf you're truly offended about something, then do something about it. Take action, don't just complain. If you're just taking things too personally, instead take a deep breath and try to take things with a grain of salt today. 😉💗\n-\n📸: @iliscrub",
