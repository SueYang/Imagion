As she opened a fresh bottle of vodka, she told me that her family and now her boyfriend, who had left a few days ago, had rejected her. As she broke down in tears she said that her mom, who used to hit her, died from chronic alcohol abuse. Ashley has left the community and is sober. #Runaflirts, @runa_photos, @thephotosociety, @panospictures",
