Two from the three attacked accounts have been released. I'm so glad for Taline @talinegabriel and Viola @thesunshineeatery. But I can't understand why it takes so long for our friend Edgar @odysseusaspires (I'm tagging his personal account here). On another note I'm thrilled to see that this weekend two wonderful food photography workshops are held and I'm so exited to follow their journey. One takes place in Point Reyes CA by @bliu07 #ptreyesworkshop2017 and another @bundarafarm AUS #workshopwiththemacadames \nHave fun ladies üì∏ @feedtheswimmers @thebarefoothousewife @thebotanicalkitchen @the.flo.show and all the othersü¶ã\n.\n.\n.\n#welivetoexplore #livefolk #thehappynow #theartofslowliving #lifestyle #styling #tulips #pink #interiorstyling #flowermagic #instablooms #bloom #botanical #floweroftheday #igersdaily #vscocolor #vscogram #vsco #tastyasheck",

      "description": "There's a new rumble in the house, called \"shadow banning\". If you like to read some opinions you may check my friends post's Rita @ritaserano Sara @shisodelicious Nina @nourish_atelier Marie @papaya_sunshine and Jo @healthyeating_jo (I support their point of views 100%). What I want to spread is positivity here and that's why I love to share this photo I took at a joint photo shoot with Fanny @fannythefoodie and Carrie @harrysding I would have never met these ladies without our connection on Instagram. I wouldn't know that Fanny is writing her first cookbook and Carrie shares so many interests with me. I would have never spent the most amazing #summerfoodiesinfrance where we cooked up a storm and shared our ideas, together with Rita and Sara {already mentioned above}, Olivia @adelasterfoodtextures and our #avomonday powerhouse Bettina @bettinas_kitchen. \nTwo years ago Bettina and Sara organized a London meet up where I met Kimberly @thelittleplantation Samira @alphafoodie Zita @foodfightsuk and many more. \nWhen I travel I have the opportunity to meet even more friends since we all are strongly connected. Berlin ladies Sophie @luckystaranise and Susanna @mehlstaubundofenduft \nThe Munich crew was awesome too, Kerstin @curlew_and_dragonfly (get well soon lovely) , Shabnam @thehungrywarrior Katinka @keightys Susanna @eatsleepgreen \nThere are so many more that it's impossible to list them all. \nI love that all these wonderful humans and myself got amazing opportunities (jobs, collaborations) through their unique work which they display on their feeds. Last but not least I wish luck to my girl Nadia @nadiadamaso_ebnl and one of my favorite guys here Timothy @mississippivegan with their upcoming book projects. \nSorry, I couldn't tag moreüôà\n.\n#sharethelove #sharethecheer #friendship #gathering #kinfolk #tablesetting #foodphotography #foodphotographer #foodstylist #fellowmag #provenciallife #diewocheaufinstagram #bloom #botanical #floweroftheday #verylimoment #eattheworld #dslooking #beautifulmatters #nothingisordinary #slowliving #thatsdarling #livethelittlethings #tastyasheck",

Originally from Hawaii, poke means \"to cut\" (pronounced \"posh-kay\") description from the February issue of @bonappetitmag \nIt happens that the first poke restaurant opened in Zurich (for once we're not behind ;-) @ona_poke. I'll be there for lunch very soonish. \nHere's my version starting at 12 o'clock: smoked tofu, pineapple, candy beet, pickled radishes, pickled ginger, cucumber, watercress, baby avocado and forbidden black rice for the base. Topped with scallions, edible blossoms and toasted black sesame and tossed with a shoyu-blacktahini-lime-coconutsugar dressing. \nIf you're looking for more inspiration I warmly recommend the latest issue @freshandlight by @donna.hay #notsponsored #poke",
