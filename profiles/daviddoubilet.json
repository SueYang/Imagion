      "description": "A gallery of life on the Great Barrier Reef. The late largest most iconic coral reef system may be located in Queensland Australia but it really belongs to the world. When I was a kid the Great Barrier was the first reef on my radar of imagination. Today the worlds largest coral reef is literally in hot water. Sequential coral bleaching events in 2016 & 2017 have affected 900+ miles of the 1400  mile long structure. Thermal stress causes the coral polyp to lose its symbiotic algae that  provide color and supplemental nutrients.  Unprecedented back to back bleaching have left this great reef with little time to recover and struggling to survive.  These images were photographed on assignment with @natgeo available at @natgeocreative natgeocreative #ocean #coralreef #greatbarrierreef #climatechange #followme for #moreocean @jenniferhayesig and @daviddoubilet",

      "description": "An American crocodile patrols the mangrove channels of Gardens of the Queen National Park Cuba. The crocodile rested on the seagrass covered bottom of the channel for minutes at a time and then rose slowly to take a breath of air and returned to the bottom to sleep again. Crocodiles are called the engineers of the mangroves because their movements create and maintain channels that enhance circulation of water and nutrients through the dense roots systems. Photographed on assignment for @natgeo Cubas Underwater Jewels in the Path of Tourism.

      "description": "A very large and curious Maori wrasse followed our team around Sno Reef on the Great Barrier Reef. This big guy weighed several hundred pounds and had spear wounds from unsuccessful poaching encounters. The corals on the Great Barrier Reef are now in the midst of another unprecedented coral bleaching event. High sea temperatures in 2016 caused 90% of the 1200 mile long reef to bleach, a process where the tiny coral polyp loses its symbiotic algae due to heat stress. The algae provide valuable life sustaining nutrients to the coral and give it its color. If conditions improve quickly  enough some corals can recover from a bleach event while others die and become covered in algae. Scientist estimate that 20% + of the Great Barrier Reef corals did not recover during the 2016 event. The extent of the 2017 bleach is yet to be known. Sequential bleaching events weakens the corals resilience and speeds the death of the reef.

The croc was swimming at a lazy pace in the downstream current and became mildly interested in our cameras. If you look very closely you will see my partner, Jennifer Hayes, just behind the croc.  Our encounter was welcome and too brief before the magnificent creature became bored with us and drifted away in the current.

      "description": "A harp seal pup called a \"whitecoat\" swims from one piece of ice to another in Canada's Gulf of St Lawrence near Prince Edward Island. I photographed these seals in a year  of elevated temperatures  with low to moderate ice cover. It was a bad year for seals in the gulf because the weak ice did not withstand a large storm that broke up the ice nursery  killing 90%+ of the seal pups. This year is shaping up to be worse. This week thousands of pregnant harp seals are searching for ice that does not exist. We are on standby to travel to the gulf as conditions allow to document the harp seals in the Gulf of st Lawrence as they face climate change and a world without a nursery. For more about the Gulf of St Lawrence see @natgeo \"Generous Gulf\" online at NatGeo.com and stay tuned for more about the harp seals.

Encountering a hatchling in the wild is extremely rare because predation is high and survivors are few. I have only met a handful in my lifetime. These remarkable creatures are ancient mariners in the sea that battle over harvest, habitat loss, marine debris entrapment and now they face rising sea levels that threaten nesting beaches.

A number of leopard seals were patrolling the shore near a large penguin colony waiting for a meal. These large seals are playful, curious and predatory.  We have to be cautious and vigilant while photographing them in the water on their terms. I am happy to have a large camera housing between them and myself for two reasons: 1 it attracts their curious nature and 2 the housing acts like a Roman Shield when they become TOO curious.
