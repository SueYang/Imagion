      "description": "Blue-and-Yellow Macaw, One of the most recognizable of the #Macaw, this bird is popular as a pet throughout the world thanks to their ability to talk and bond with humans. wild populations are found in South America and ranging as far north as #Florida. The Blue-and-yellow Macaw is not a light bird so the primary feathers have to be long and strong in order for the bird to be capable of sustaining flight. The Macaw's flight feathers are shaped with a shorter leading edge and a longer trailing edge. The leading edge is curved and forces air  over the upper surface of the #wing creating lift during flight.",

These iridescent birds live in large flocks where the females interbreed with multiple males for larger genetic diversity, while the males pair with a single female for life.

      "description": "I am not sure how I missed DNA Day, I did....But it is never to late for Some good DNA.  Charles Darwin came up with his theory of evolution by carefully observing the natural world. Yet on this day, 25 April, in 1953, the scientific community glimpsed new possibilities afforded by a microscopic way of understanding the natural world, when Cambridge researchers Francis Crick and James Watson published their paper, Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid, a molecule better known to us all as DNA. “Nothing has revolutionized the classification of species more profoundly than the study of their DNA,” explains Joseph Wallace in our new book, Evolution: A Visual Record. “The mapping of entire genomes (an organism’s complete set of genetic information) - which has been completed in hundreds of species ranging from sponges and sea anemones to birds and mammals - has, in some cases, clarified our understanding of species relationships, and in others thrown it into doubt and confusion.”",

It was the empire capital city with an estimated population of 40,000-60,000 people.\n\nAfter the Inca conquered the #Chimú around 1470 AD, Chan Chan fell into decline. In 1535 AD, Francisco #Pizarro founded the Spanish city of #Trujillo which pushed Chan Chan further into the shadows. While no longer the capital city, Chan Chan was still well known for its riches and was looted by the Spaniards. A sixteenth century indication list of items looted from a burial tomb in Chan Chan; a treasure equivalent to 80,000 pesos of gold was recovered (nearly $5,000,000 US dollars)\n\nChan Chan is in a particularly arid section of the coastal desert of northern Peru. Due to the lack of rain in this area, the major source of water for Chan Chan is in the form of rivers carrying surface runoff from the #Andes. This is one of those time when the light is awful, but you convert a picture to black and white which turns it into another way of seeing a scene.\n@natgeo @thephotosociety",

According to ancient mythology and folklore, it would be the three gods Thor, Odin and Freyr lying in Uppsala  In the 19th and 20th centuries, they were speculated to hold the remains of three kings of the legendary House of Ynglings \nIn fact, the oldest Scandinavian sources, such as Ynglingatal, the Westrogothic law and the Gutasaga talk of the King of Sweden as the \"King at Uppsala\". During the Middle Ages, it was the largest village of Uppland, the eastern part of which probably originally formed the core of the complex of properties belonging to the Swedish Crown, the so-called Uppsala öd, of which the western part consisted of the royal estate itself, kungsgården.\n\nThey are dated to the 5th and 6th centuries. The location was chosen carefully and in order to make them majestic. \nAs the legends go, by the burning of the dead king and his armour, he was moved to Valhalla (heaven)  by the consuming force of the fire. The fire could reach temperatures of 1500 °C. The remains were covered with cobblestones and then a layer of gravel and sand and finally a thin layer of turf. #vikings #Uppsala @Natgeo",
