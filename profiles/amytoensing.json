      "description": "STRONG WOMEN :: For the next 3 weeks @whitneycatherinejohnson and I will be curating an assignment for the @natgeoyourshot on Strong Women in honor of the story we just produced on widowhood in the February 2017 issue of National Geographic magazine. For more information go to the link on my IG Profile. Please share and submit!! UGANDA: This is Betty Nanozi who has been fighting for her land for over a decade simply because her husband died. Many widows in Uganda are marginalized and threatened. They can be forced out of their homes, robbed of everything they own, made to marry a brother-in-law, physically attacked or harmed—even their children can be taken away from them. A grant from the @pulitzercenter helped fund this project. Visit @ijm / International Justice Misison to Learn more about the issue of widows in Uganda and how you can help.",

I never thought that I would not hear my English teacher again, who I love so much in Syria, but that’s alright. I never thought I would not breathe the smells of Syrian fields in summer night, but that’s alright. But to whom it may concern, please…stop war and let me go back to my past life.”",
