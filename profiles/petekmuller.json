A beautiful research center and library to boot! Here, an extraordinary picture by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema entitled The Women of Amphissa.

      "description": "The large boulders behind my friend, Joe, make up what's known as King Phillips Cave in the town of Norton, #Massachusetts. King Phillip's War was a campaign of fierce, cyclical violence that occurred between 1675 and 1676 between English settlers and the Wampanoag, Nipmuck and Narragansett Indians. It is widely regarded as the largest loss of life (per capita) in the history of the United States and a key event in the formation of colonial identity in the territories. I grew up in Massachusetts and learned virtually nothing about it in our public schools. It felt deeply disconcerting to cross the street from Joe's house, past a string of newly-constructed million-dollar homes, to this small protected site. As we explored the rock formations and thought about what they signified, a man ran a snow blower on the driveway of his palatial home. During my visiting professorship at Mount Holyoke College, I've been reading an incredible book about King Phillip's War by historian Jill Lepore. An important book for all. #MA #nativeamerican #wanpanoag #kingphilipswar #winter #newengland",

He's retiring after a 35-year stint as the art conservator at the @princeton_university Art Museum. Beyond the Princeton museum, he has more than 50 years of experience in the field of art conservation. It's remarkable to consider. I drove from Massachusetts to New Jersey for the night to attend the celebration of his contribution. Time marches on. What a bitter sweet affair. #dad #retirement",

This year, we enjoyed a lovely dinner prepared by my sister, Irene, exchanged a few, small gifts and took advantage of the opportunity to be together. One of the most wonderful things about teaching at Mount Holyoke College this semester is its proximity to my family in eastern Massachusetts. Coming home so often makes me painfully aware of how much I miss when I'm so far away. I'm very grateful to have this time together. #family #USA #birthdays #winter",

      "description": "The winters in Massachusetts are as tough as I remember--but sledding helps a little. We've had two significant snow storms over the last week and they've left me thinking. I'm immersed in literature about the human propensity to band together in order to confront challenges. Many scholars argue that modern humans have been naturally selected for our ability to cooperate in the face of threats; that those who failed to participate died and therefore left fewer descendants. While a snowstorm in the modern era poses nominal risk, I can't help but feel that it ignites something primordial within us. In particular, I think it does something to men, who suddenly feel needed. A snowstorm creates a small window in which male physical strength becomes an valuable commodity. They can more easily shovel wet heavy snow, push out vehicles and execute other tasks in which strength is an asset. As much as we claim to hate these storms, I think they evoke something important and meaningful within us. #massachusetts #USA #snow #winteriscoming #winter #ipswich",

Each year, as an enshrined rite of passage, the freshman class must complete a grueling five-day, 55-mile hike along the Appalachian Trail. “The experience teaches kids to help one another,” explains Edwin Leahy, the school’s headmaster. “It creates a sense of community that is frequently not taught to young men. It’s this rugged individualism that gets communicated.” The all boys’ prep school in Newark, New Jersey aims to impart an emotionally aware and expressive form of masculine identity. “If young guys don’t find constructive means of expression, their anger either gets expressed outwardly in poor behavior or inward as self destruction,” Leahy adds. #boyhood #manhood #masculinity #gender #hiking #SBP #Saintbenedicts #newjersey #natgeo",

      "description": "And so, pondering my own journey decades before, I followed the boys of Saint Benedict's Prep into the woods. For many, it was a first foray into the wilderness and a stark departure from the urban centers of their upbringing. Griping and discomfort defined the initial days as they adjusted to the absence of showers, arduous hikes, and food—prepared by the boys themselves—that left something to be desired. They razzed and cajoled one another and, quite quickly, structures of leadership and cooperation emerged. Resistance gave way to a quiet and collective determination. #boyhood #gender #masculinity #manhood #natgeo #genderrevolution #saintbenedicts #newjersey #sbp",

      "description": "A group of students from Saint Benedict's Prep School in Newark, New Jersey head out on the Appalachian Trail. The journey, which serves as an important rite of passage as students pass from their freshman to sophomore year, consists of a grueling, 55 mile hike over the course of five days. It was on a similar but longer excursion that I found some redemption from the troubles that defined my own adolescent years. It was there, in rural Maine, away from the noise and the haste, that the social pressures of masculine performance ebbed and I found room to reengage with myself. It gave me room to consider the choices I'd made and the emotional aspects of my misbehavior. “The backpacking trip is huge here,” Father Edwin explains. “It teaches kids of help one another and creates a sense of community that is frequently not taught to young men. It’s this rugged individualism that gets communicated.” #boyhood #masculinity #gender #outdoors #discovery #genderrevolution #teens #saintbenedicts #sbp",

      "description": "Today, I am honored to take over the @national_gallery Instagram account! In support of the Gallery's ongoing exhibition #BeyondCaravaggio, I'm sharing work that was influenced by the Italian master painter.  I was pleased to collaborate with Letizia Treves, head of the Gallery's Curatorial Department and curator of Beyond Caravaggio, to contextualize the images. I'll return to posting photos from my @natgeo project on boyhood and masculinity starting tomorrow. ____________________\n\nExhausted from a long day in the fields of rural Ivory Coast, a man sits resigned in his doorway. Brimming with childhood exuberance, his young neighbor does a handstand against their shared wall. The aesthetics of the picture were influenced by the master painter, Caravaggio. Letizia Treves, the curator of #BeyondCaravaggio, ruminates on the painter’s particular influence in the image, “The strong directional light in this picture, silhouetting the edge of the doorway and window behind, remind me of Caravaggio’s Calling of St Matthew in the Contarelli Chapel, San Luigi dei Francesi (Rome) – Caravaggio’s first major public commission. The way the light catches the outstretched arm and hand of the seated man also recalls Caravaggio’s illumination of Christ’s important gesture in the painting – his outstretched arm calling Saint Matthew to follow him.”",

      "description": "Boys at Saint Benedict’s Prep in Newark participate in physical exercises in preparation for the backpacking expedition, a grueling, five-day, 55-mile trek through the Appalachian Mountains. The trip is a formative rite of passage for the school's rising sophomore class. \n__________________________________________ \nSaint Benedict’s emphasis on boys attaining emotional awareness struck a chord with me—now a man of 34 who spent most of my adolescent and teen years flirting with serious social dysfunction. My parents split when I was a child and their separation, however minor in the scheme of human suffering, upended my emotional world. Their separation occurred as I was starting to understand the social parameters of my nascent masculine identity. Like most boys, I quickly learned that tears and other expressions of sorrow were met with coercive social ridicule. Despite its destructive potential, anger seemed the only acceptable form of masculine emotional expression. And so, within the confines of my prescribed gender, I disguised my sadness as rage and soon found myself on the edge of destruction. Fistfights, suspensions and other forms of social malady defined my adolescent and teen years. #men #boys #masculinity #manhood #gender #genderrevolution #saintbenedicts #SBP #NewJersey #NJ #newark #ritesofpassage",
