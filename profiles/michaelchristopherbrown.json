      "description": "highly recommend reading the post on @magnumphotos, an overview of photographer paul fusco’s great book rfk funeral train. how it relates to this picture: in early december 2016, when fidel castro died, the cubans organized a military convoy to carry his remains inside an urn across the country. hundreds of thousands of cubans came out to the highway to pay their respects, and though no photographers (besides government photographers in the convoy) were allowed access in the convoy, i thought of fusco’s work and a need to somehow photograph what was about to happen on the road, not to replicate but for history. i had already rented an suv, as my girlfriend and i were touring cuba when fidel passed, attained a press pass and planned to somehow get behind or in front of the convoy as much as possible, to photograph the cubans along the road from havana to santiago. i made press signs and posted them inside all corners of the suv, put the hazard lights on, hired a cuban truck driver and stood out the window of the back seat, over the hood. to the amazement of the driver and myself, we were able to access many sections of the route by just looking somewhat official. we never stopped driving for fear of being pulled over by the cuban police, military or secret service along the road. maybe due to the gravity of the event, that cubans had never experienced a national/international news story of this magnitude, were we allowed to enter the route each day. we would drive ahead or behind the convoy, the road to ourselves, through cities where seemingly every citizen was standing alongside the road. sometimes cubans seemed to think we were with the convoy and some realized we were just a press car passing. regardless, according to the cuban driver many may have thought i was ‘the most important photographer in the world' due to the access and in disbelief we thanked che, also a photographer. am now editing thousands of images into a book",
