      "description": "Each spring the wild flowers come into bloom at the Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve, a section of the Mojave Desert Grassland habitat. As the winters’ precipitation determines the intensity of the bloom, this year’s much needed record rainfall resulted in a firework of colors lighting the gentle rolling hills of the valley.\nGenerally the season starts as early as mid-February and can run through May. While many species have shed their petals, the blooming poppies are still attracting visitors, but due to their delicate nature are easily prone to closing.\n\n@natgeo @natgeocreative @thephotosociety #poppies #superbloom #wildflowers #antelopevalley #california #mojavedesert",

      "description": "At 1:23 am on April 26, 1986, reactor # 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant blew up. The radioactive fallout spread over thousands of square kilometers, driving more than a quarter of a million people permanently from their homes. More than 100,000 people may have succumbed to Chernobyl-related illnesses. It remains the worst nuclear accident to date. More than 30 years later, the long shadow of Chernobyl continues to darken lives — socially, environmentally, and physically.\nIn the 1970s, the town of Pripyat was constructed for the plant’s personnel but its 50,000 inhabitants were evacuated 36 hours after the accident. Now, wind blows through the desolate and chilling ghost town. In 1986, this amusement park was being readied for the annual May Day celebrations, when the reactor # 4 of the Nuclear Power Plant exploded less than 3 kilometers away.\nLearn more about Chernobyl from my book and iPad App “The Long Shadow of Chernobyl”  @thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative #Chernobyl #Pripyat #Ukraine #TheLongShadowofChernobyl #nuclear #disaster #environment",

Their research concentrated on the area's wild boar and roe deer.  After the animals' dissection, then performed in a makeshift lab in a former kindergarten kitchen, their stomach contents were analyzed.\nThis image is from my ongoing project of the Chernobyl disaster and its continuing aftermath.\n\nYou can learn more about Chernobyl from my book and iPad app The Long Shadow of Chernobyl\n\n@natgeo @natgeocreative @thephotosociety #TheLongShadowOfChernobyl #ChernobylAnniversary #nuclear #powerplant #environment #Disaster",

It examined the attitudes and outlooks of young people in Russia, now in their mid-twenties, who were barely ten years old when Putin first became President.\n\nSupporters of the Other Russia, an extremist opposition party, rally in Moscow, displaying flags and armbands with their symbol, a hand grenade. The Other Russia was formed by members of the banned ultranationalist National Bolshevik Party, originally founded by poet Eduard Limonov, but it is not recognized by Putin’s government.\n\n@natgeo @thephotosociety @natgeocreative #Russia #Moscow #youth #flags #rally #red #politics #OtherRussia",

The book is now in stores (signed copies from my website), but my project continues. \nIn Los Angeles County there are more than seven million registered vehicles. They work all day to create two of LA’s most infamous commodities: traffic jams and smog. But where do all those cars go to rest? \nBy nature, I am a night owl. In what Kafka called his most productive hours, when dream and reality meet, I go out to photograph sleeping cars. My cars are loners. They command their own space and enjoy showing off their presence. Like a devoted bird watcher I have learned to recognize their sleeping patterns. With voyeuristic pleasure I’ve spied on them in their nightgowns. I’ve watched some sleep in the nude; some take afternoon naps and the few lucky ones get to sleep together. \nA few times the police have stopped me in my work, wondering what I was doing out in the streets in the middle of the night. Was I a Peeping Tom or even worse, a paparazzo? The cars in this project are photographed as I find them, I generally don’t like to disturb them in their slumber. \nFollow @sleepingcars to see many more images of sleeping cars in LA and around the world. \n@natgeo @thephotosociety @natgeocreative #SleepingCarsBook #SleepingCars #LosAngeles #mood #car #coveredcar",

It lies 227 feet below sea level with no outlets and very thirsty neighbors, including a billion dollar farm economy in the bone-dry Imperial Valley, 124 golf courses in the adjacent Coachella Valley, and salt laden wetlands hosting a menagerie of wildlife in growing crisis.\n\nWith two feeder rivers and no outlet, the water level depends on evaporation, which in return increases the Salton Sea’s salinity. Now a concern is looming.\n\nAlready 25% saltier than the Pacific Ocean, the salinity in the Salton Sea is expected to further increase, potentially killing all of its life and turning it into a biologically dead sea. \nThe photograph above was taken during my 2016 workshop on the Salton Sea. A quietly decaying ship rests on the shores of Bombay Beach. I’m planning to drive to the Salton Sea tomorrow in order to check on the latest developments.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative #SaltonSea #California #environment #boat #bombaybeach",

While Douglas is best known for his images of Marilyn Monroe, he is comfortable shooting studio portraits, fine art nudes and fashion, to just name a few categories. His career spans over 6 decades, he photographed on countless movie sets and is still working at 82. \nWith his permission I am posting a gallery of images taken from his new book “Freeze Frame: Second Cut” by Glitterati. They offer a glimpse into the most iconic films and lives of celebrities of the last 60 years with photographs that balance glitz and glamour with honesty and insight.\n\nThe 10 photographs in the gallery show Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Judy Garland; Marilyn Monroe; Betty Davis; Katherine Hepburn;Henry Thomas; Meryl Streep; Mariel Hemingway; Angelina Jolie; cover of Freeze Frame; Douglas and Françoise Kirkland\n\n#celebrity #books #douglaskirklandphotography #movies #freezeframe",

The 24-year-olds are prominent members of the city's death-defying \"roofer\" community, also called skywalkers. They scale Russia’s highest buildings, without safety gear, often entering illegally, bypassing security and using whatever tools necessary to reach their destinations.  Defiance of authority and the rule of law is in the roofers’ blood and that is why they have fallen under the system’s watch wrote the Moscow Times.\n\nThis photograph opens the gallery of the “Best Photos of 2016” which @natgeo just published. The images were selected from 107 stories by 91 photographers and out of over two million photographs. The photograph here was the opening image of my recent story, The Putin Generation, which ran in the December issue of the National Geographic Magazine. The story examines the attitudes and outlooks of young people, now in their mid-twenties, who were barely ten years old when Putin first became President. \n@thephotosociety @natgeocreative @theimagereview #Russia #Moscow #roofers #skywalkers #spire #architecture #city #rooftops #urban #adventure",

      "description": "The British news publication 'The Independent’ recently reported that the robots sent into Fukushima for cleanup are “dying” at a rate five times higher than expected. Although designed to survive in highly contaminated areas, large amounts of radioactive material are eating away at the robots wiring – rendering them useless.\n\nSix years ago, on March 11, 2011, Japan was hit by one of the most severe earthquakes in recorded history. In the subsequent tsunami the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant suffered serious damage that led to several meltdowns in the nuclear reactor releasing large amounts of radioactive materials. It was the largest nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nThe news of the robots’ malfunction reminded me of the few times I went into the ill-fated Chernobyl reactor - deeper than any Western still photographer.\n\nThe photographs in this gallery were all taken during several short visits deep inside the crumbling Chernobyl reactor. Radiation levels are so high there that both I and the heavily protected workers were only allowed one shift of 15 minutes per day.\n\nMy 20 years covering the aftermath of the Chernobyl catastrophe resulted in the book and iPad App ‘The Long Shadow of Chernobyl’, both available on the store of my website. \n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative @theimagereview #chernobyl #ukraine #LongShadowofChernobyl #fukushima #nuclear #disaster #radiation #anniversary",

According to the Arthurian legend, it is the entrance to Avalon – a mythical place where the fabled king awaits his return into this world. The Tor has been identified with King Arthur since the alleged discovery of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere’s coffins in Glastonbury Abbey in 1191. \nThis photograph is included in my new book “minus 2/3”. In the book, I take the viewer behind the scenes of many of my images to share my approach to lighting with small flash.

      "description": "More than 30 years ago, reactor # 4 in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant blew up. With more radiation released than in Fukushima, It caused the world’s worst nuclear disaster to date. \nIn 2011, the Ukrainian government officially legalized tourism into the Exclusion Zone. Today a chilling ghost town, the city of Pripyat was originally built for the scientists and workers of the CNPP and their families. School # 3 in Pripyat, famous for its assembly of children’s gas masks spread out on the floor offers a surrealist still life in an abandoned classroom. It is one of the most popular tourist attractions. The origin of the gas masks is somewhat unclear. Some people suggest boxes of gas masks (which every school in the whole country had in storage) were originally opened by scavengers and spread out all over. \nToday, the space is rearranged by tourist providers to cater to their customers’ expectations and enhance the impact of the experience. \nYou can learn more about the Chernobyl catastrophe from my book and iPad app, which resulted from decades of covering the aftermath of the disaster: “The Long Shadow of Chernobyl,” available here - http://www.gerdludwig.com/store/\n @thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative @theimagereview #Chernobyl #CNPP #Pripyat #stilllife #abandoned #destruction #radiation #toxic #gasmask #LongShadowofChernobyl",

Here, the Khanty participate annually in traditional events and competitions during the \"Fishing and Hunting Day\" which attracts several thousand Khanty and non-Khanty visitors.\n\nThe expansive modernization and economic growth generated by Russia’s oil and gas industry have been a blessing for most of the region’s 1.5 million inhabitants, but not all.  Roughly 30,000 indigenous people hailing from the area’s Khanty and Mansi tribes still populate the region, but their traditional way of life is quickly disappearing.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative @theimagereview #Siberia #KhantyMansiysk #Khanty#Mansi #indigenous #Russia #competitions #reindeer #sledrace",

Swipe left to see more photos of cosplayers from my recent story, published in the December issue of National Geographic Magazine, titled The Putin Generation. Cosplay, a shortening of the words costume and play, is a performance art, during which participants wear masks, costumes, and accessories to depict specific characters. The characters stem from comic books and cartoons, live-action films, or video games. Cosplaying initially became a popular culture phenomenon in Japan but has since spread worldwide. I was surprised when several cosplay festivals took place in Moscow during my time there last summer. On assignment for @natgeo I attended three events where I made contact with cosplayers, whom I then photographed separately in their homes. Like in the rest of the world, cosplay in Russia crosses social and economic boundaries - the people I photographed were lawyers, tailors, students, bankers, artists, animal trainers, just to name a few. \n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative @theimagereview #Russia #Moscow #cosplayers #costume #youth #PutinGeneration",
