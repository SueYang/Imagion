      "description": "Inside the Italian asylums which were used to treat the mentally ill until they were ordered to close in 1978 and left to become overgrown houses of horror.\nThe Italian metal asylums were abandoned in 1978 and since then nature has tried its best to reclaim them.\nThese haunting images of abandoned hospitals across Italy are not one for the faint hearted.\nTaken in top secret locations, both of the hospitals featured in the photographs are Italian Asylums - otherwise known as Manicomios - which were used as mental hospitals.\nShut down by law in 1978, the derelict buildings are visibly very overgrown, and create very eerie portraits.\nTaken by Thomas Windisch, 32, from Graz in Austria, he said the asylums can get very creepy when there aren't many people there with him.\nHe said: 'Doing research in history about these places, you realise a lot of bad things happened there.\n'In asylums it's sometimes scary when you know you´re alone in there and a door slams moved by the wind.\n'But I love places where you´re captured by the past. It ignites my imagination and i can see the places in my mind like they´ve been in the past and what might have happened there.\nMuch of the asylum has been untouched by human hands since it was abandoned, but nature has changed it beyond recognition.\nSome of the equipment looks like it should be used in the torture scene of a Bond movie rather than a facility concerned with healing.\nEven though the building was abandoned in 1978, it has received plenty of unauthorised visitors over the past four decades.\nvia dailymail\n#abanddoned",

      "description": "The Valley of the Mills or “Vallone dei Mulini” is a group of abandoned brick buildings nestled in the deep valley floor of Sorrento, Italy. For more than 600 years, these mills supplied flour for Naples and the surrounding regions,  producing over a million bushels of wheat every year. Its location along the river Vernotico also gave it a role in storing water during periods of drought, making it an important source of sustenance in the region.\n\nEven after a huge earthquake caused by a volcanic eruption which devastated the Mediterranean area, the mills still stood, suffering only a deep crack in the rock foundation of the buildings. However, by the 1940’s the mills were completely abandoned as the milling of flour was shifted to nearby pasta mills and the onset of taxes overtook the business. Since then, nature has been reclaiming the land, the Valley of the Mills is slowly fading out of sight.\nSorrento, Italy | Photography by© Larissa Dening (@larissadening)\n#abanddoned",
