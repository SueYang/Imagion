The fact that Jewels and I had both separately stumbled across this guy and ended up together was the best. We literally cruised with him for an hour and I loved every minute of it. This was Lakeside, a popular snorkeling site in the national park and your best bet of seeing turtles on the fringing reef in Ningaloo. @WesternAustralia #JustAnotherDayInWA",

Well, specifically at the Shangri-La Jakarta because I haven't left the hotel literally at all, this was a really unique and random trip. If you missed my story the other day it goes a little like this ... I decided to do a 'status run' because I'm really close to upgrading to Platinum as a Qantas frequent flyer. If you're not an aviation geek you probably don't know the extents that we go to for this stuff. lol. Anyway I wanted to go somewhere that would enable me to upgrade and I wanted to spend four days holed away in a hotel room writing content for my online photography course. I got a great recommendation for the Shangri-La and an introduction and they agreed to look after me in Jakarta. At the last minute Dreamboat decided to join me so I really haven't gotten any work done at all but at least I am well rested and feeling fabulous for the weekend ahead. Yay!

If you've been sitting on the fence then time to jump off because it is going to be an epic, epic day! We've got at least a dozen people coming from really far away. (think USA, Switzerland, Hawaii and New Zealand) We have a dual Olympian coming! We have amazing writers and traditional media who would be great to  network with. Olympus is there with all their gear and have actually ended up sponsoring a handful of our past delegates. We have a second brand so close to confirming their attendance and there's even a chance of a major show coming to film some snippets. Basically this is going to be our biggest and best event so far! Finally, Olympus have very, very generously offered 15% off for anyone booking today off social (a deal we have only shared with our email database). Just use 'OLYMPUS15' at checkout and get in quick because there's only a handful of tickets left and if we sell too fast I will close sales. See you on the weekend in Melbourne!

So one of the coolest things about swimming with whale sharks in Ningaloo is that every single boat on the water has a plane up in the air doing all the hard work of locating the animals. (Not a plane per boat, usually one for every 3-4 boats.) These 'spotter' planes are piloted by amazing pilots such as Tiffany and Jacob from Ningaloo Aviation. Not only do they spot whale sharks but they also offer scenic flights and this would be a huge recommendation from me! Jewels and I were incredibly fortunate to go up for two flights, one during the day to see whale sharks and one for sunset. If you look closely at this shot you can actually see the eco tents of Sal Salis and how well they blend into their surroundings, nice location hey? Thanks @NingalooAviation #JustAnotherDayInWA",

      "description": "Good morning!!! I'm sure a few people by now are wondering what Sal Salis actually looks like and I do have a few shots of the place and some aerials too. This is from inside one of the eco-tents, isn't it so cute?! The entire place has only 15 tents so the maximum number of guests is usually 30 but there's always some kids kicking around too, they get to sleep in swags inside or outside. üò± When you check in you are thoroughly briefed on how it all works, i.e. There is a nature toilet (no flush) and the water allocation for showers is 20L per guest per day. Of course Jewels and I had to have a photo shoot, the #JewLau creativity came out big time. üòÇüòÇüòÇ I loved this sunset session. üî•üò≥üíÉüèºüåû @WesternAustralia #JustAnotherDayInWA",

      "description": "Before I tell you anything else about this photo I just want to mention that we had \"bad\" conditions in Ningaloo! That's right, this is what bad, windy, choppy conditions look like! üò±üòÇüê† As you know I was staying at Sal Salis and all activities are included when you stay, with the exception of swimming with the whale sharks. The team all get together every afternoon to decide what activities best suit the conditions for the next day and then they write a handful of options up on the chalkboard for you to put your name down for. So, on day two we chose to snorkel at Lake Side and Jewels and I found a turtle and basically stayed by its side for an hour and a half. I seriously couldn't love turtles more, they're like the grumpy old men of the sea. The funniest thing was that Jewels and I found this guy independently of each other and when I stuck my head out to tell Jewels I noticed she was right next to me, she did the same thing.

      "description": "Omg, yesterday's whale shark post made me so happy and I promise I'm still catching up on comments. I wrote until my hands were sore and I was falling asleep! As I mentioned I've been at Sal Salis, @salsalisningaloo if you want to check them out, and it's been an amazing stay. Sal Salis has just been accepted into Luxury Lodges of Australia and it has to be one of the most incredible places I've stayed. Not only is the property beautiful but you can feel great for staying there because the entire camp is an ecotourism development camp. You'll sleep in a wilderness tent with an eco toilet, no air conditioning and limited daily water but I swear I've never been more comfortable. Also, don't even get me started on the food and wine and activities. This is a shot from my last night after quite a few wines over dinner. üòÇüòÇ I always seem to do star shots better that way. üôàüç∑ @WesternAustralia #JustAnotherDayInWA",

      "description": "I'm back and OMFG OMFG! Jewels and I teased that we were going offline for a few days and this is why! Bucket list dream has been ticked off ... swimming with whale sharks in Ningaloo. Although there is obviously service in the area we have just spent three incredible nights at Sal Salis (digital detox!) and also did a full day out on their own boat, \"Live Ningaloo\", the only boat operating in the area that takes just ten guests at a time. I have an incredible amount of images to share from the whale sharks and the last few days here on Australia's largest fringing reef. All underwater images have been shot on Olympus. This image is an incredibly rare shot, whale sharks are solitary animals and only interact with other whale sharks when they literally collide in the water. I died, literal death! You can imagine how Jewels was. üòÇüòÇüê≥üíô @WesternAustralia #JustAnotherDayInWA",
