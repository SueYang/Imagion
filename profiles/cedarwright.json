      "description": "About a week ago I broke the Boulder paragliding site distance record, and at the end of a gorgeous 4 hour flight found myself 100kilometers away near the border of Wyoming!  It's not a crazy proud record by modern paragliding standards, but I'm still really stoked to have it for the time being, and it's wild to think how much I've learned in the last two years of obsessive paragliding!  If you haven't already, please check out my film The Fledglings Uncut, which documents the early stages of my paragliding adventures with @mattsegal ...the link to the film is in my profile.  Also thanks to everyone who has supported the film so far!  @thenorthface #skycrack. This is a more recent photo I grabbed of my buddy Josh Finkelstein flying the Boulder site where I snagged the record.",

I launched from Glenwood Springs, and flew over 80k, all the way to Vail using just nylon, string, and thermals!  Big thanks to @sendinglife for guiding me through the technical part of the flight before disappearing on his own 100k vision quest!  The views were other worldly, and the experience surreal.  Spring is respected and sometimes feared by paragliding pilots, because this is the time of year when some of the strongest, most rowdy thermals can be found.  At times I was being ripped into the sky at over 1100 feet a minute!  Wow! @thenorthface @fiveten_official #skycrack",

In the last year she's done big wall linkups in Zion, climbed 5.13r trad in Eldo, ran a 50k ultra, looked dead sexy...etc...all while holding down a full time job as a Public Defender, and putting up with my antics... which is also a full time job.  Love you to the ends of the earth honey!!!",

I had a fun night hanging out with @moinmountains James Scheri, and Craig DeMartino from @paradoxsports  Paradox is a rad climbing community of people with and without disabilities, that are working together to make climbing more accessible for people who might be blind, missing limbs, or even in a wheelchair!  My life has been made immeasurably better by my love for climbing, and for a veteran with a traumatic injury, someone coming back from a catastrophic car accident, or somebody recovering from limb loss because of cancer, a good old fashioned climbing gym session can be just as if not more life changing in such a wonderful way!  I really encourage folks to check out @paradoxsports and get involved, and or donate a little cash to the cause!  @thenorthface",

      "description": "I spent the last week in Valle de Bravo Mexico participating in the Monarca Open paragliding competition.  I learned a ton, and hope someday I can compete at the top level in this wonderfully outrageous, fringe sport.  For now I got a solid middle of the pack placing in my category.  Racing Paraglider's down complicated and committing  courses marked by GPS delineated goalposts, using only the invisible rising air of thermals to make forward progress is one of my newest passion/obsessions for sure!  Here my buddy Josh Finkelstein glides over Valle's lake, the goal for many of last weeks flights!  I may or may not have landed twenty feet from the shore one day, destroying my iPhone and my pride!
