      "description": "I visited Cape Town, South Africa in 1996, two years after Nelson Mandela was elected President. Seeing two little girls, one black and the other white, on a school trip to a vineyard brought home the reality of the sea changes that were sweeping the country. During subsequent visits, it was obvious that the legacy of apartheid still inhabited every corner of South Africa. It is 'a country of two nations', yet no one could have predicted the progress that started with the twin concepts of truth and reconciliation--now it is possible to believe that South Africa could serve as a model for other nations which struggle to recover from wounded histories.",
