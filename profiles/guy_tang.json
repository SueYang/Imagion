I am glad I found my new hair girl to do it for me, along with her assistants @hairbyjoohee @ha._____.eun @amin__2da now I have someone in LA. Yay! The best part is they are also huge @guytang_mydentity  Haircolor users too so you can go get your hair color done by them and request for #mydentity color. Thank you to my hair guy @nam_studio who cuts my hair too. This perm technique is from #korea so it's rare to find someone in the US who does the Iron Perm. Do you HairBesties love my hair Permed or straight?üòçüòçüòç @create_professionel",

      "description": "Hello all HairBesties! I made a visual chart here to help explain @guytang_mydentity colors in RoseGold. Rose Gold perception is different in everyone's eyes. Some see it warmer and some see it cooler and some see it as Pink! Both models on the chart were done with the same formulas but on two different starting levels. #mydentity 7rg is the cooler side of Rose which appear more violet(to some)when wet until dry then you will see the Rose tone. If applied to a level 10 bleached hair it will appear more on the cooler side but when applied to a level 8 will appear on the warmer side. 9rg is a soft creamy rose gold but look how it will appear different on a level 10 over a level 9. It's part of the color wheel and let's embrace the many variations of #RoseGold, 10Rg is a lot more pink because it's in the permanent color category design to lift and control underlying tones while blushing the hair with an iridescent Rose reflection., if you put 10rg permanent on bleached level 10 hair, you will get Pink because there is no background to support the delicate Rose Gold effect but hey if you like pink then go for it! But some see pink as fuschia and some see it as magenta. We can't expect Rose gold to be one tone because there are many variations. Here is the formula on the 2 models with two different starting levels.\nRootag√©: 7rg demi with 6vol\nFormula 2: 7rg+9rg with 6vol \nFormula 3: 9rg with 6vol \nProcess on dry hair for 25mins \nMix 1:2 for acidic gloss or 1:1 for opacity and 5min low heat option and 20min cool down helps longevity. You can also add #mydentity Pink Glow booster to increase the pink vibrancy to your formula! Have fun and share! I love you HairBesties #HB4L",
