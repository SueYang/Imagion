I cry at nights thinking that no one is there for me.” Bobby is a gay man from Jamaica. He has been forced out of his home, threatened, beaten, raped and attempted suicide. “What I am writing here can’t even explain all u have been through because it’s hard for me to talk about and there is so much more to tell as I said, my story could write a book. You want to express yourself but living in Jamaica you can’t do that because they will kill you even if you act girly they will beat you.” -\nRead Bobby's story shared with the #WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBT stories of survival, at the link in our profile.

Then I learnt it was homophobic bullying because I was being teased and called “fish”, “faggot”, “battyman” and other degrading names. For half of my life I felt as though something was wrong with me. I thought maybe they were right for teasing me.” Elton is a #gay man from #Jamaica. In high school he felt the strongest effects of bullying, but he overcame their prejudices and now advocates for rights of #LGBT Jamaicans. “I would want to encourage others to never give up, be your best self and remain true to who you are. That bully might just be somebody lacking love and attention. Never let the fear of giving in let you give up.”\n-\nRead Elton's story shared with the #WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBT stories of survival, at the link in our profile.

I could never feel comfy in those clothes, because I never accpeted that I was woman. In fact, looking at my reflection grew more painful each day. My breast grew and along with it, hatred for myself. My period came and I could feel my heart break to pieces coming to the realization that I was trapped in a body that I felt was never mine. I've done everything I had to understand who I am and I'm happy to say that I am a transgender man.” Will you be Zion's ally?\n-\nPledge your support to #LGBTQI+ Jamaicans and become an ally today at www.isupportthelgbt.community (link in our profile).
