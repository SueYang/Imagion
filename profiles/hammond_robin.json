His only crime was to have a mental disability. I made a promise to myself that I would do something for the thousands of people like him in countries with insufficient resources to effectively care for people with mental health issues. \nIn many countries around the world, the people I spoke to said there was still so much stigma around mental health. I hope you will join me in fighting stigma and creating a better world for people who need mental health support. \n1 in 4 people around the world, experiences a mental disorder or psychosocial disability in their lifetime. \nIn some countries, 98% of people with mental illness and intellectually disability receive no treatment\n\nFind out more at \nhttps://witnesschange.org/condemned/\n\n#worldhealthday #worldhealthday2017 #letstalk #mentalhealth #stopstigma",

      "description": "“She had made me stay in a chicken hut for three years... her friend told me that its because of the way I behave like a girl that I might rape her kids. It hurt me so much.” Raymond is a #transgender woman from #Uganda. She has faced discrimination for most of her life, but she hadn't felt real fear until the media started 'outing' LGBTQI+ Ugandans: “Things worsened when my face appeared in newspaper on the front page. I started receiving phone calls threatening me from different corners that they are going to kill me and my land lord threw me out that he doesn’t entertain gay people.”\n-\nStarting 14 November, Transgender Awareness Week helps raise the visibility of #transgender and gender non-conforming people, and address the issues the community faces. #transweek\n-\nRead Raymond’s story shared with the #WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBT stories of survival, at the link in our profile. At the link you can also see how to share your own experience of #discrimination and #survival and how you can support. Photo by @Hammond_Robin /@noorimages. This is a @witness_change project.

      "description": "\"I don’t want to describe what I felt that evening and how much I was scared, because I don’t want to remember these attacks over and over again, it’s very painfully… Now as I am writing this, I’m hold back the tears because of the shame, because it seems like it's forever, so it will be again and again. And the anger is so much. I’m sick of always being the victim.\" Ruslan shared his story with the @WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBTI stories of #discrimination and #survival.\n\nOn Friday November 18th, #WhereLoveIsIllegal creator Robin Hammond will be speaking as part of @FotoWeekDC in partnership with @natgeo.

      "description": "Photo by @Hammond_Robin for @natgeo. Was a very nice surprise to find this in the bookstore in Kingston, Jamaica. I was very moved by the story of this family: \"We are doing fine here, and we were well received,” says Abed Mohammed Al Khader, 88, patriarch of a family of 16 that fled Syria two years ago, but “we want to go back.” This past February they arrived in Berlin and were given shelter, with 1,500 other refugees, in a large gymnasium near the Olympic stadium. The Syrian and other refugees streaming into Europe since 2015 have roiled its politics and tested its tolerance. But they’re just the latest of many waves of immigrants since World War II that includes Indians in Britain, Algerians in France, Somalis in Sweden, Turks in Germany.
