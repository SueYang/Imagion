Duvarlar sanki gizli bir sırrı fısıldıyor: “Gel”. Attığım her adımda; bana rehberlik eden yazıyı okuyarak ve sanki yankısını duyarak ilerliyorum: “Gel, gel”. Bu beklenmedik iz sürme oyununa ayak uyduruyor ve takip ediyorum. Kendimi sözün ahengine bırakıyorum. Arıyorum, her sokağın köşesinde bekliyorum. Sonra birdenbire  karşıma çıkan kapı, geçmişe tanıklık eden mezar taşlarının olduğu geleneksel tarzdaki bir bahçeye açılıyor. Sufi filozofu Mevlana’nın derviş okulundayım. İlahi ritimlerin arasında, mistik bir dansla sonsuzluğa doğru dönen derviş de burada, bir eli gökyüzüne, diğeri toprağa uzanıyor... Tıpkı Tanrı’nın mesajı gibi: “Bizler, gökyüzü ve yeryüzü arasındaki enerji döngüsünün üzerinde bir düğümüz”.

She walked, holding her child close, a heavy but precious and warm bundle, her body upright despite her fatigue, moving forward, against all odds. There are many such courageous souls throughout the world, in countries where infrastructure is minimal, moving along the roads, from one village to the other, from one dispensary to the next.\n\nText written by Rachel Deghati. \n#woman #afghan #blue #niqab #child #motherandbaby #motherandchild #travelphotographer #travelmemories #documentaryphotography #photodocumentary \n#picoftheday #igers #photooftheday #photojournalism #reza #rezaphoto #rezadeghati #rezaphotography #rezaphotojournalist #webistan ##عكاس#رضادقتى @thephotosociety",

      "description": "World Book and Copyright Day\n\nKurdistan Regional Government, Iraq, #Sakran\nSince 2013, I have been working on a book and exhibition project on the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq. I wanted to highlight its culture, its country and its people that, in the midst of troubled times, seek to bring peace to the Middle East. \nHere, in this house of the village of Sakran in Iraqi Kurdistan, a discreet veil preserves the books of time. Completely destroyed in 1977 by order of Saddam Hussein, Sakran lives again since its reconstruction in 1991.\nAt the beginning of my teenage years I was a serious student and I had just left the town where I was born; Tabriz to go live with my relatives in Tehran. \nThere was a reason that drove me towards becoming inventive. I had to quench my insatiable thirst for reading, which my father’s modest salary was unable to afford. I had discovered an abandoned room on the mezzanine floor of the college, and I had the idea that it could recapture its heart and soul in the form of a library. I shared my plan with my father, who encouraged me, saying his only wish was that I should take complete responsibility for it myself.\nAfter launching an appeal for gifts of books and magazines to all the parents of the educational institutions in the area, after devoting my holidays to labelling and classifying the 630 books we had collected, and after cleaning the room and putting up shelves, the great day arrived—the inauguration in front of an audience of parents, teachers and principals, along with some students. \nThe following summer, and every afternoon when classes were over, the library became my home port, being me in charge of loans. I would sail away reality every time I read something. It was my sanctuary. \n#KurdistanRenaissance #kurdish #bookstragram #book #bookday #worldbookday #iraqikurdistan #kurd #kurdistan #picoftheday #igers #photooftheday #photojournalism #reza #rezaphoto #rezadeghati #rezaphotography #rezaphotojournalist #webistan #رضادقتى عكاس @thephotosociety",

      "description": "Easter\n#Dohuk, #IraqiKurdistan\nOn this Easter day, at the #Church of St Ith Llaha, this young girl had the face of an angel or a very young madonna, and radiated a pale, almost divine light, accentuated by her ochre scarf. Her ageless gaze was filled with the peaceful silence of an internal dialogue – a true spirituality, a far cry from dogmas and rituals.\nThe most significant celebration of the Christian religion, Easter commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ and is celebrated throughout the world. The Christians of Kurdistan have not yet renounced their faith, despite the unremitting war that continues to rage throughout their devastated country.\n#easter #religion #celebration #spirituality #littlegirl #portrait #portraitphotography #face #christian #christianity #kurdish #angel #KurdistanRenaissance #kurd #kurdistan #picoftheday #igers #photooftheday #photojournalism #reza #rezaphoto #rezadeghati #rezaphotography #rezaphotojournalist #webistan #رضادقتى عكاس  @thephotosociety",

The community lives in harmony with the diverse groups that make up the society of Reunion Island. For the most part, the communities are open to both groups of other religious persuasions as well as atheists and such occasions bring together people from every corner of the island who participate in the discovery of another culture over several days. Prayers and ceremonies dedicated to the divinities, ritual baths, offerings of thanks, traditional vegetarian meals, performances and dances mark this event, which is celebrated throughout the world. \nHappy new year to the Tamils of Reunion and Hindus everywhere: may the solidarity of the Reunion communities spread throughout the world.\n\n#tamil #newyear #celebration #spirituality #reunionisland #livetogether #tolerance #hope #iledelareunion #picoftheday #igers #photooftheday #photojournalism #reza #rezaphoto #rezadeghati #rezaphotography #rezaphotojournalist #webistan ##عكاس #رضادقتى @thephotosociety @reuniontourisme",

In this region, the entire population has been abandoned by the those in power. The money from the pipeline that wends its way past their miserable habitations goes right into the pockets of the “Lords of the Punjab,” thus dubbed by the venerable #Baloch chief, Akbar Bugti. #Bugti was a former minister and member of Parliament who was assassinated when he tried to fight for #Balochi rights.\nIn this region, the poorest of the poor are undoubtedly the nomadic tribes, like these young women, who constantly wander the barren mountain region.\nText written by Rachel Deghati.

But, as the men and women jumped out of their makeshift craft, we could see their terrified faces etched with exhaustion that were telling a very different story: hell lay on the other side of the river.\n\nAmid the eloquent silence of the media, the massacres between the Hutus and the Tutsis had begun. We were four photographers sent by Reporters Without Borders to raise public awareness about the massacre which was taking place amidst deafening indifference. The battlefield was the border lake of Cyhoha, swarming with those on both sides who were fleeing certain death. A man descended from a listing wooden boat. He seemed to be clutching some material in his hands.\n\nAs I approached, I realized that he had bundled a tiny baby who had just been born in the midst of this hell.\nText written by Rachel Deghati. \n#rwanda #rawandagenocide #hutu \n#man #african #tutsi #africa #drama #genocide #neverforget #RSF #baby #father #picoftheday #igers #photooftheday#photojournalism #reza #rezaphoto#rezadeghati #rezaphotography#rezaphotojournalist #webistan #رضادقتى عكاس @thephotosociety",
