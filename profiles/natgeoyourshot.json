      "description": "Tokyo from 23-05 | Photograph by Dean Cobin\n.\n“Sometimes you go looking for a shot and sometimes a shot finds you. Having traveled to Tokyo many times I specifically went to the Shibuya Station area to shoot the famous crossing,” writes Your Shot photographer Dean Cobin. “When I got to my hotel room 23 floors above the city, I was greeted by this wonderful view of the city from my window. When night fell I set up my tripod, put on a title shift lens for perspective control, and got my best shots without ever leaving the room. I envisioned this is as a black and white shot from the start.”\n--\n“Tokyo is a city that ranks at the top of my travel wish list. The buildings and architecture always seem like they were designed with a future aesthetic. You were right in thinking that this would make a great black and white image. I love the added details of billboards and the street lights.” — @natgeoyourshot associate photo editor Matt Adams (@themattadams).

      "description": "Top Shot: Hearts in the Sky | Photograph by Charleton Churchill (@charletonchurchill)\n.\nYour Shot photographer Charleton Churchill captured this landscape image in the western region of Nepal, near Mount Everest. He was preparing to photograph his two friends, James and Ashley, who were getting married that day. “We were on our way to Everest Base Camp in March 2017 to have James and Ashley get married and be the first to do it in a wedding dress and tuxedo,\" writes Churchill. \"On the way to base camp that morning, I took a photograph of this beautiful landscape and when I went through my images, I saw two hearts in the sky, like a puzzle, where the two hearts became one.”\n--\nTop Shot features the photo with the most votes from the previous day’s Daily Dozen, 12 photos chosen by the Your Shot editors from thousands of recent uploads. Our community votes for their favorite photo from the selection, and the Top Shot is showcased on the @natgeoyourshot Instagram account. #YourShotPhotographer",

The expression on the monkey and the comfort this infant needs from the close contact is visible here. Hunting the mom, leaving the infants is horrid and mentally scarring.” — Fine art/editorial photographer Robin Schwartz (@robin_schwartz) #YourShotPhotographer",
