Although the first manned missioned to Mars is still a few years away, NASA is already looking for people who would be interested in traveling to the Red Planet. Recently, NASA released eight, retro-style posters recruiting explorers, farmers, surveyors, technicians and teachers. All of the posters are currently available for free download on NASA’s website. “Have you ever asked the question, what is out there? So have we!” one poster caption reads. “That curiosity leads us to explore new places like Mars and its moons, Phobos and Deimos. Just what lies beyond the next valley, canyon, crater or hill is something we want to discover with rovers and with humans one day too.” Shoutout to our friends @Tech for the awesome post!",
