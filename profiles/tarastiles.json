      "description": "Reposting this gem from the lovely @tiamowry\n🌿\n💫\nAlso I've been feeling pretty invincible to be honest lately. And I feel a consistent dropping feeling in my chest that I can only assume comes along with ushering in & caring for new life. I'm just starting to ease into life outside of our bubble & am excited more then before & amazed at the direction my life has taken. It's not like I had life stacked against me, but nothing would put it on paper for me from there to be me, now here. And this is what is incredible about life & completely a matter of choosing to trust intuition, be brave when life is scary, be tough when the world seems against you, be humble when the world sends you praise & most useful for me, prioritize improvement.\n.\nMy life feels like a responsive process of intention in action. When I sharpen the intention, fuel it with service, I'll always be fully supported. My wings strengthen & spread. Let my fears & insecurity rise, spend time critiquing the imitators & cheaters & the branch weakens. Spend time letting myself be frustrated & the branch cracks. A fall is imminent. Spend time simmering in creativity, individuality & love & the wind magically appears & flight begins with no ending in sight.\n💫\nCurrently trapped under a napping baby being grateful for all the things.",

I think she likes the diversity & action of the city but not the noise & disruption. Me too lol. Can't blame her. Soon we go to nature. Adventures await!",

A preview right here.\n💫\nWelcome to Guide Talk, an exploratory column to converse in the quest for ease for ourselves and the tingling desire we all have to share and help as many as we can. I’ve been dreaming to start a place to share the awesomeness that the Strala Guides do out in the world.\n💫\nWe ultimately give others the experience of how we feel about ourselves, making our number one job getting really great at getting to know ourselves, improving our wellbeing, and a heavy dose of constant self care. As we expand, do our thing, express our individuality, and live out our intentions to help and serve, we share a common message and practice of ease, whether the situation is simple or challenging.\n💫\nWe celebrate uniqueness in ourselves and each other. It’s a wonderful state of mind knowing we all desire to be healthy, happy, strong, and crave a life of meaning and purpose, and free to express our unique selves. Our true power rests in being comfortable in who we are as we grow and thrive in this world.\n💫\nI'm in awe of this community of Super Guide, ease makers. It’s been several years of watching this tribe expand and create such awesome work in the world, help people along the way, and have fun in the process.\n💫\nI’m blessed to be a part of this shift from no pain no gain to natural movement, and accomplishing with ease. The Guides are my heroes and friends and everyone is invited to the party.\n💫\nContinue to watch this space for inspiring interviews, raw conversations and all around good vibes.\n💫\nI'm so proud and inspired by my friend, Sandrine Bridoux,@frenchyogagirl Super Guide, Yoga Teacher, Former Lawyer, Retreat Leader, and Author of her first book, Yoga Sculpt.\n.\n.\n.\n#stralayoga #guidingstrala #stralaeverywhere #yogasculpt #sandrinebridoux #yogabook #yoga #yogaeveryday",

      "description": "Because it's Monday I present to you my Pizza Hut uniform. One of my high school jobs.\n🍕\nI also taught dance since age 9. I proposed an adult beginner class for the moms. Loved teaching that too.\n👯\nI also sold blow pops out of my locker (on the side). My Dad is still annoyed he had to start filing taxes for me at age 9.\n🌈\nI just love to be productive & be around people & try to help in some way, whether that is folding Pizza boxes to make sure the staff doesn't panic during the dinner rush or asking someone how they are when they walk into @stralayoga nothing much has changed.\n🌿\nI strived for a life of freedom then & now. Doesn't matter what your job is, how you are radiates through others & back to you. Cultivate good vibes & you can have just as much fun bringing someone a refill as giving a talk on stage to thousands. I've done both & one can be as exciting as the other.\n🦋\nIf you are frustrated at where you are now you will be frustrated even if you get where you think you want to go. 😊\nHow you are in one thing is how you are in anything.\n🌱\nI do miss those days when the Pizza Hut manager would flip when it got too busy & I would run around & find little things to do to make everyone's job easier & the customers happy. Loved doing whatever needed to be done, even if it wasn't my \"job.\" My job is to always do whatever I can to make the atmosphere harmonious. A customer once wanted some soda we didn't carry & I ran out to the gas station across the street to get it. I folded all the boxes when I got to work to prepare for the day. Manager thought I was OCD (boxes everywhere) until rush hit & we never ran out. Ha! Love that little stuff.\n🌸\nLeadership is all about creating flow. More on this in my new book, Guiding Strala. And yes, working at Pizza Hut has big life lessons.\n🙈\nP.S. my mom held onto this & all of my old stuff for when \"I got famous\" she always said I was such a ham & always needed to achieve so if you want strips of my childhood bedroom wallpaper I can hook you up with her.\n🍕\n😳\n🌿\n#stralayoga #guidingstrala #lesdership #leadership",

      "description": "I spotted @miketaylor8 sliding in the door to take this pic & I thought OMG where is my baby! He was in charge of her during the class. Good news is she survived & was in her stroller just out of my sight.\n🌈\nI was so nervous about this class today. We were so excited for everyone to meet Daisy & this morning I thought what was I thinking!? What if she totally flips out & is impossible to soothe. My heart will break if she is uncomfortable or overwhelmed. I'm such a bad Mom to introduce her to this many people all at once.\n😬\nBut funny enough, like usual, she was in a great mood, blisssd out after eating & a nap & ready to meet her friends. She is wise & chill. We are blessed.\n🙏🏼\nIt was awesome to lead class again. Felt like a fresh start in our community comfortable home, where it all started for us #stralayoga people, well technically 2 studios ago it started, but this is the space everyone feels all fuzzy about. Now we are a global community of ease chasers, Guides, studio owners & friends. Home is where the heart is & my heart is with all of you & currently living outside of my body in Daisy. Thank you all for being so sweet with her digitally & in person. We are a lucky family to be with you. See you soon.\n❤\nNext event is the May Intensive & then June class & Guiding Strala book launch. Both events still have some space if you would like to join. \nDetails & sign up info at the link up top. (Check events once you get to stralayoga.com )\n🏡\n💫\n🌼\n🌿\n#stralayoga #guidingstrala #stralaeverywhere #yoga #nycyoga",

If you didn't get a space and would have liked to join (sorry this one filled up pretty fast) we have another class / party for Guiding Strala book 📚 launch June 3 (still some space) our Intensive May 20-21 (a bit of space) & 300 hour Advanced Leadership Course this July (some room, get in touch about qualifying for this program)\n💫\nAnd there is Chicago Intensive June 24-25 & then off to Europe this fall, London Intensive Sept 9-10 (a couple spaces left) & 200 hour Ready-to-Lead in Amsterdam (a few spots for this one) working on a little thing for Paris while we are there for the launch of Strala Yoga in France & then there is 2018 already up for registration. Wo. Can't wait to see you all and for you to meet Daisy. I hope this lady likes to travel.\n💫\nFor our NYC friends, some of you know us mostly as a yoga studio with daily classes, and are kind of shocked when we have so many international friends and Strala Guides visiting all the time. Literally each class could be the beginning of a bar joke. A German, a French gal a group of Japanese people and a Rabbi walked into Strala. . .#yogaeverydamnday.\n💫\nLeading daily classes & running a regular yoga studio has been amazing (especially the vibrant community here in NYC, you are fun to sweat & breathe deep with) We all strive to follow how we feel & it's been wonderful to transition to using our studio & next door office to host you for special events & workshops & trainings. I love having the open space for planning programs, making videos for you and running around in our underwear singing in between flights (kidding kind of)\n💫\nLet us know any requests for classes, workshops or programs. It feels wonderful to have an open space for strala and plenty of room left for creativity.\n💫\nGo after what gives you goosebumps.\n💫\nMy door is always open. See you soon.\n.\n.\n.\n#stralayoga #guidingstrala #nycyoga #yogatraining #taichi",

      "description": "Haven't showered today but we have figured out the baby wrap for hands free house hanging.\n☀️\nNot gonna lie, I have been really enjoying staying at home, going for walks with her, staring at her while she sleeps, holding her while she wakes, playing with her on her tummy, singing songs with her, meditating with her & reading with her. I even adore her explosive diaper moments.\n☀️\nHaving her now in my life instead of much earlier, I have the huge fortune of not feeling the need to get out there & achieve my life. I'm beyond blessed to be part of an established movement (I humbly acknowledge my career is a collaboration of our entire @stralayoga family of Guides, friends, leaders & supporters. I do a lot, but we all do & we accomplish so much more together)\n☀️\nI get to organize my own schedule completely around my intention, desires & goals. We planned several months with no travel or events & are able to just be with her & soak it all in. I wouldn't change anything for anything. I'm having the time of my life (and I really really really enjoy everything else I get to do in my life)\n☀️\nBig props to all the stay-at-home & working moms & dads & partners out there. This is the job of a lifetime.\n☀️\nOk, back to staring at her. See you soon.",
