      "description": "@stevewinterphoto @natgeo\n\nI am working on a @natgeo Jaguar story. Here is Scarface running after a caiman which he did not get this time. Jaguars are the 3rd largest of the big cats. Found from US / Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in this area where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguars range. Also poaching for skins, bones and teeth is growing for the first time since the 1970‚Äôs to feed the demand for Asian Traditional Medicine and luxury items from endangered species. ‚ÄúWhen the buying stops, the killing can too.‚Äù @wildaid @bertiegregory\n\nMy first story with big cats was the 1st @natgeo Jaguar story 20 years ago! It has changed my life working with the magical and magnificent cats of the world. Animals have emotions just like we have-kids hang out and play like these 2 cubs.. Forests provide us with up to 50% of the oxygen we breathe - oceans the rest. They give us 75% of the fresh water.\nIf we can save the forest of the Amazon and other areas in Central and South America for the JAGUAR and Puma. The forests of Central Africa for the leopard, lion, elephants etc. And the forests of South Asia for the Tigers and Leopards. If you save the top predator in any ecosystem you save everything that lives with them.\nSo if - We Save Big Cats we can help Save Ourselves.  Please visit CauseAnUproar.org to find out other ways to become involved to save big cats!\n\n#follow me @stevewinterphoto to see more images from my work with @natgeo and Thanks!! @stevewinterphoto @natgeo @nglive #nglive @natgeochannel @natgeowild @thephotosociety  @natgeocreative  #fursforlife  #BCI #bigcatsintiative  #startwith1thing @projetooncafari @refugioecologicocaiman @pantheracats @pantanalsafaris #canonusa #redcine @africanparksnetwork #ldfoundation @leonardodicaprio @sanctuaryasia @canonusapro",

Now it is making good on that promise: 67 ivory carving factories and retail shops across the country will close down on Friday, and the rest by the of the year. This is great news for the 30,000 elephants killed each year for their tusks in Africa.\nWe can each participate on social media and make our voices heard for the elephants that have no voice in their future. When the buying stops the killing can too.\n When the buying stops the killing can too!! @wildaid\nAs every 15 minutes a elephant is killed for its ivory.

      "description": "@stevewinterphoto @natgeo\n\nI am excited to bring my NG LIVE presentation, ‚ÄúOn the Trail of Big Cats‚Äù to @natgeo‚Äôs Grosvenor Theater in Washington DC on April 13th! Come hear about my life and work with Jaguars, Snow Leopards, Cougars and Tigers!! For tickets to my show click on the link in my bio.\nThis huge male tiger feels the need to show us who is the boss here in Bandhavgargh National Park, India. \nWe need to realize deep in our hearts that animals have emotions too. If we can treat them better - maybe we could find some empathy inside of us to treat each other better also.\nThere are only 3400 tigers left in the wild! We need to fight for the right of tigers to live - peacefully and without being killed for the traditional medicine market, tiger bone wine, tiger skin furniture and other trade. Help stop the demand for endangered species used in this practice! ‚ÄúWhen the buying stops, the killing can too‚Äù #wildaid\nOur animal family is so much like us - they find mates, they have kids, they have to feed themselves and their families, \nthey feed themselves and their families in the same way we as humans used to! If we can find a way to believe they think, feel and have emotions, maybe we can treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. \nThey are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not. The forests and grasslands of big cats give us 50% of our oxygen and 75% of fresh water. If we can save big cats we can help save ourselves!\nJoin National Geographic's Big Cat Initiative, www.causeanuproar.org #bigcatsforever\n Follow me @stevewinterphoto to other images and thanks!\n@stevewinterphoto @natgeo @nglive #nglive @natgeochannel @natgeowild @thephotosociety  @natgeocreative  #fursforlife  #BCI #bigcatsintiative  #startwith1thing @pantheracats @pantanalsafaris #canonusa #redcine @africanparksnetwork\n#ldfoundation @leonardodicaprio @sanctuaryasia",

      "description": "@stevewinterphoto @natgeo\nWomen bring their tea leaves to be weighed at the end of the day on the edge of Kaziranga National Park. In many areas of the world the economy is run by women, though they do not benefit the same as men. When women run local economies-children benefit.\n\nKaziranga is an incredible diversity of life - the area has the largest population of Indian one horned rhinos, Asian Elephants and wild water buffalo left in the world. And the highest density of tigers found anywhere in the world. It is a ‚Äúhistoric landscape‚Äù where tigers live as in centuries past - with many species listed above that are gone from other tiger reserves. A Jewel in the Crown of India.\n\nForests provide us with up to 50% of the oxygen we breathe - oceans the rest. They give us 75% of the fresh water.\nIf we can save the forest of the Amazon and other areas in Central and South America for the JAGUAR and Puma. The forests of Central Africa for the leopard, lion, elephants etc. And the forests of South Asia for the Tigers and Leopards. If you save the top predator in any ecosystem you save everything that lives with them.\nSo if - We Save Big Cats we can help Save Ourselves.  Please visit CauseAnUproar.org to find out other ways to become involved to save big cats!\n\n#follow me @stevewinterphoto to see more images from my work with @natgeo and Thanks!! @stevewinterphoto @natgeo @nglive #nglive @natgeochannel @natgeowild @thephotosociety  @natgeocreative  #fursforlife  #BCI #bigcatsintiative  #startwith1thing @projetooncafari @refugioecologicocaiman @pantheracats @pantanalsafaris #canonusa #redcine @africanparksnetwork #ldfoundation @leonardodicaprio @sanctuaryasia @kaziranga @india",
