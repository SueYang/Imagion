      "description": "Yesterday while on a date with my husband, I got hit with one of the worst migraines of my life. Since we weren't home, I couldn't do my little migraine hacks during the first 15 min of the visual aura (if you are familiar with migraines there is a window of 15 min where you see flashing lights and go partially blind before you get the migraine) so it was the first time in awhile I've actually had a full blown migraine. \n_\n\nNot to be dramatic, but I thought my brain was swelling to the point I might actually die. For 5 hours I laid in a dark room and tried my best to sleep it off but who can sleep with that much pain? I couldn't post for #effectivehandstands which I have never missed posting for one of my challenges before but really, I didn't think anyone would care. \n_\n\nToday, I'm in the \"migraine hangover\" stage as I call it where I have a bad headache, eyes are swollen, and I feel like I got hit by a truck. I have to figure out a way to stop these migraines because I can't live this way. \n_\n\nSo, before you give me all your suggestions just know that I've tried them ALL. I'm the kind of person that will try anything anyone tells me if it means I don't have to endure this pain anymore. Really though, right now I'm feeling so down and depressed about it because nothing has worked. \n_\nIf you get migraines or know anything that maybe has worked for others feel free to leave me a comment. üôèüèª Thank you for your continued love and support. I love you guys!\n\n#migraine",
