      "description": "Today we’re celebrating trees—it’s Arbor Day. I made this image of a grove of buttressed jungle trees festooned with other plants to express the interdependence of life inside a rainforest in Belize. Tree trunks carry nutrients between the forest floor and the canopy. Fallen leaves and other organic debris are broken down by organisms in the soil, then their nutrients are absorbed by tree roots and carried back up to the canopy with remarkable swiftness. In a tropical rainforest, from the moment a leaf falls to earth to the time it is decomposed can take as little as three weeks. We’re all dependent on trees—what they exhale, we inhale. We are linked together in the cycle of life.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeotravel @natgeocreative #ArborDay #RainForest #Trees #Nature #NaturePhotography #Beauty",

Parents cradle them on their feet to keep them warm and off the sea ice. It takes heroic parenting skills to raise a chick in this brutally cold environment where temperatures can drop to 40 degrees below zero with winds of more than 100 miles per hour. I spent a month camped on the sea ice near an emperor penguin colony to document how the chicks grow up. Browse through my feed for more images and stories about these remarkable birds.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeotravel @natgeocreative #Penguin #Nature #EmperorPenguin #Antarctica #Chick #Parent #Nurture #Love #WorldPenguinDay #naturephotography",

      "description": "Photo by @FransLanting My home along the coast of California is situated in prime cougar habitat, and for a number of years I’ve deployed camera traps to document this elusive cat. One of my favorite locations is an overgrown trail that comes out of a steep wooded canyon and passes right next to our land. One morning a wary male passed by an old oak tree festooned with lichen. The look in his eye epitomizes the character of this cat. Cougars were nearly wiped out along the coast of California near Santa Cruz where I live, but since they were given protection in 1990, they’ve rebounded. They now occur even at the edges of towns and cities, but they are very good at avoiding people. The comeback of cougars in California is a success story, and it shows what can happen if we’re tolerant of apex predators and if we’re protecting enough wild land where they can survive. Stay tuned for more images that celebrate wild California.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeotravel @natgeocreative #mountainlion #california #santacruz #Panthera #wildlifephotography #nature #BigCatsInitiative #celebrate #earthfocus #wildlifeplanet",

      "description": "Emperor penguins raise their young on the sea ice surrounding Antarctica where there is no vegetation or rocks with which they could build nests. When the young are just born, parents brood them on their feet. But a few weeks later the chicks start wandering around on their own. I came across this one, maybe a month old, at the edge of a colony, where it was awaiting the return of its parents. Without a nest site to come back to, emperor penguins and their offspring have evolved an amazing ability to find each other by sound. Imagine the cacophony of parents and chicks calling each other. It’s remarkable that this all works out. Truly a wonder of nature!

It’s a testimonial to the richness of this Southern Ocean ecosystem and the importance of this island at the edge of Antarctica as a sanctuary for marine life.

These black-browed albatross chicks have a long way to go before they can lift their wings and become the supreme flyers sailors have admired for centuries. They’re all sitting on mud nests built by their parents, who are searching the open ocean for squid to take back to their downy offspring in the Falkland Islands. I love albatrosses! To me they are among the most amazing creatures on the planet. I never get tired of watching them and photographing them.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeotravel @natgeocreative #naturelovers #life #picoftheday #ocean #inspire #wildlifephotography #amazing",

      "description": "This male elephant seal is exhausted. He’s lost a lot of his body weight after weeks of fighting and fasting on a beach on South Georgia Island in the Antarctic. If you’re born as a male elephant seal you’re in for a life of all or nothing. Males weigh up to 4,000 pounds; they bulk out like prizefighters to gain a physical advantage over rivals who fight each other intensely to take control over beaches where females haul out. A handful of males get access to most of the females; all the other males are out of luck. Pups are born a year later on the same beach where they’re conceived. Check my previous posts to see how adorable the pups look during their first two months. After that they turn into super-size seals. Stay tuned for more tales from South Georgia, the island of superlatives.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeocreative @natgeotravel #sleep #worn out #aggression #competition #nature #photooftheday #wildlife #naturelovers",

      "description": "Eyes full of innocence light up the face of this elephant seal pup which is less than two months old. Yet it’s already been weaned by its mother, who nourished it for a month with milk that is one of the highest in fat content of any animal on earth, and now it’s languishing on the shores of South Georgia before it takes a plunge into the cold waters of the Southern Ocean. Elephant seals dive deeper than almost any other marine mammal; some of them go farther down than 7000 feet. It takes more than big eyes to survive down there. Watch out, young seal! Stay tuned for more stories about seals and other wonders from South Georgia, the island at the end of the world.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeo @natgeotravel @natgeocreative #cute #amazing #nature #ocean #life #awesome #photooftheday #wildlifephotography",
