      "description": "Those of you who purchased our calendar (thank you!) will turn over the page tomorrow to begin May with our sweet Creatch, Bella. I haven't been able to post about her since we lost her suddenly last December. I still think of and miss her terribly every day. But please do not be sad when you look at her judgmental but very cute face this month. I would rescue her all over again if I could, even if it meant losing her again too. She lived a good life, and will be forever remembered for her bad attitude, dislike of my son and puppies, costume changes, love of mud (and crap, and disgusting things...), her constant bark, occasional cuddles, and especially for her role as captain of the fun police. She can never be replaced. I'm sure she is barking, policing, and speaking street spanish over the rainbow bridge still üêä #sheddoitagainese üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöîüåà ‚ù§Ô∏è #rescuefamily #foreverinmyheart",

      "description": "The sun was shining while we were all out this morning so I grabbed my \"real\" camera and took some quick shots (swipe right ‚û°Ô∏è). I wanted to share them with you all and also, while I am not a professional photographer, people have asked so I thought I'd share a few things that have helped me with my photos. I hope someone can find it useful! üòÄ*Use a good camera and a better lens. I have a Nikon D610 and used a Nikkor 24mm lens today. *I now shoot mostly in Manual but take advantage of your standard camera modes! I use Aperture priority and Shutter priority (A, S) modes the most. (A) is for photos that have a focal point with soft background. Use if subject is nice and still, such as a portrait. Sometimes the dogs cooperate enough and I can get beautiful photos this way. I have a flash but I never really use it as I prefer natural light. (S) mode requires more light but is used to capture the on the move shots. LOTS of my pictures are taken using this method. For both modes, play around with speed and aperture til you get what you want. If you are in (A) mode camera will automatically adjust shutter speed while you are responsible for the aperture, and opposite is true of (S) mode. I also have my camera set to Continuous, so I can take shot after shot quickly. Remember it takes lots of pictures sometimes to get \"the one\". I can take a hundred and maybe only one will turn out. *When I'm feeling really ambitious I use Lightroom to edit. Otherwise, I use the ig edit tools (much more than I use filters). Take advantage of Brightness, Contrast, Warmth, and Shadows. If you have a photo that seems really dark Shadows can be great to push that out. *Try to get at eye level with the dog. Learn where your camera center is so you can capture a moment quickly. I definitely cannot stay bent over that long! Sorry for the long boring post. If this has helped you though tag me (actual tag, not @) so I can see! #rescuefamily #adoptrescuefoster",

My heart/bff/souldog. *He really is as velvety soft as he looks. Softest pup of them all. Total Bubba Gump lower lip/under bite ü¶ê *Our weirdo. He is scared of almost everything, including the wind, yet loves to eat the leaf blower. Has Obsessive Face Licking Disorder (OFLD). You pretty much will not get away until he gets to kiss you. No apologies. *Because of his sensitivity to noises he prefers to spend evenings/nights with his best friend Roo at my son's house (same property). Over there it is very calm, no noisy puppies, closing doors, fast movements, etc. They are just 3 dudes chillin on the couch until bedtime, where Roo and Ki then cuddle up and are tucked in together under their blanket for the night. Bestest buds. *We share a very special bond, having saved each other in a way. I was getting through a very tough time in my life when he came into it. Since having him I've never looked back. When I need a breather in my day, when my anxiety peaks, I walk the woods and property with him by my side. He knows exactly what I need, sometimes before I even knew I needed it. Best medicine ever. I wish everyone could have their own Kilo security blanket, and I wish every shelter dog got the second chance he (barely) did. *He snores, has noisy gas, oinks and grunts, sneezes in my face constantly, likes to wander, destroys every toy ever, eats hoses, loves babies, prefers to be little spoon, and kibble is life. He's pretty much perfect üíì #mybestfriendisapitbull #velvetsausagelovenugget #adoptrescuefoster #rescuefamily",

      "description": "Today I am going to start a new photo series, a continuance from the #secretlifeofmisfits we did last year. Everyone has been pretty cute lately, ever developing their individual personalities no matter what age. I'll start with Lucky because - seniority... * Lucky Baller (AKC registered name, yes a rescue dog anyways) - turned 14 in February. Been with us since 9 months old. Did not get the memo that he's not 2 anymore. * Because of this lack of communication I am constantly having to protect him from himself. He still climbs stairs, chases cars, plays nonstop fetch, and inhales all of his food. * He has finally started showing signs of old man behavior lately. Basically, he does what he wants. He goes on self guided tours of the neighborhood (mostly our property), demands multiple middle of the night potty breaks (these last for what seems like an eternity each time), drinks water only from his stream, checks his strawberry patch many times daily (almost bud!), and actually goes inside on his own when he's tired sometimes (unbelievable). * He is just as obsessed with me as ever. If you want to know where mom is just look for Lucky. He is in the bathroom for every shower, and if I leave the room he follows even if it's just for a second. This makes me consider every time if it's really necessary or not to move so he doesn't have to. * I went out of town a few weeks ago and although the rest of the family was here, at bedtime he walked the house looking for me and crying. My daughter ended up having to sleep on the floor with him both nights. So, basically, I guess I'm not going anywhere anymore because that crushed me. * Lots of people ask where the strawberry üçì obsession came from. Really it's a food obsession in general, he's just discovered that there is a source and it's pretty much magic to him that they keep coming back. * Yes he's always yelling at me in pictures. He associates the camera with food and there is no time to waste when it comes to treats. \n#getinmybelly #notgettinganyyounger #timesawasting #idowhatiwant #rescuefamily * Up next, according to age order, is the magical Kilocorn ü¶Ñ",

Also, sometimes people suck... üòí @Regrann from @pricelesspetrescue -  Yesterday was a tough day for Priceless Pets, needless to say adoptions are our favorite thing. However, we often take in owner surrenders and they rip our heart out. Meet INA, she's a 11 year old chocolate lab who was surrendered because she \"barks and wakes up the baby.\" 11 years of giving her family all the love, dedication and heart she could and then she is discarded for such a small reason. We are heartbroken, she's heartbroken and worst of all - she's alone in a kennel wondering what she did wrong during her golden years of life. We hope she can find a family who will love her through her older years. üñ§ photocredit: @everglow.photo - #regrann",
