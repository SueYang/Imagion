      "description": "Spent the day thinking of @steckueli while looking through the archives for a photo of him. Nice to remember the big grin and the glint in his eye. Ueli died yesterday climbing in the Himalaya. We lost a grand human being. It was an honor to cross paths and work together with him over the years and I always felt fortunate to get a small slice of his knowledge and perspective on life and the mountains. Time with Ueli was always awe inducing particularly because you knew how much he could be doing with that hour. Those moments and thoughts will certainly be treasured. Thanks for the time Ueli. My deepest condolences to the family. RIP",

These public lands also help sustain an $887b outdoor industry that creates 7.6 million jobs. At stake is the recent Bears Ears National Monument, as well as Grand Staircase Escalante, and hundreds millions more acres of protected places, places I find sacred and important to preserve for my kids, the future and this country. President Trump and Secretary Zinke need to hear from you. The @outdooralliance has made it easy for you to send a message. Please take a moment to send a message about the importance of these protected public lands by checking out the link in my bio.",

I don‚Äôt get to see him much these days as he seems to travel non stop guiding epic ski and climbing trips around the world. I'd say he's gotten it figured out.
