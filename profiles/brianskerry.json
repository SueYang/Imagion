      "description": "Photo by @BrianSkerry. \nA large pod of spinner dolphins swim in the clear blue water off of Oahu, Hawaii. These animals hunt in the deep offshore waters at night, before returning to shallower coastal regions in the morning to socialize and rest. \nSpinner dolphins are among the most social of all dolphin species and are rarely seen alone or even in small groups. \nAfter humans, dolphins have the largest brains in the animal kingdom, relative to body size. Despite this fact, their world is very different than our own and the ways in which they use their brain is fascinating. Dolphins see much of their world acoustically, using echolocation (i.e. sonar) to determine the location of objects and distances. Dolphins also sleep with one half of their brains awake, as they need to be constantly alert for predators and because they are voluntary breathers.\n\n@ThePhotoSociety @natgeocreative \n#spinner #dolphin #dolphins #ocean #underwater #photography #nationalgeographic #natgeo #travel #hawaii #oahu #water #tropical #animals #photooftheday #onassignment #nikonlove #nikonambassador #nikonnofilter",

Along with their incredible speed, they also have one of the largest brains of any shark, relative to body size. The number of Makos has declined worldwide due to overfishing and the demand for shark fins and, as a result, the species is currently listed as vulnerable. \nEvery year, more than 100 million sharks are killed, primarily for their fins (which are used in shark fin soup). In the last sixty years, we have lost a majority of shark populations thereby decreasing the health of our oceans. \nCoverage from my upcoming story in @NatGeo Magazine. \n#mako #shark #southerncalifornia #socal #california #cali #sharks #savesharks #onassignment #natgeo #nationalgeographic #onassignment #follow #underwaterphotography #photography #nature #photooftheday #nikonlove #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador",

Sadly, many reef systems around the world today do not have these animals, as they have been fished to dangerously low levels. Every animal plays a vital role in the health of an ecosystem and when individual species are removed, the entire environment breaks down.

Bluefin stocks have plummeted in recent decades, as they are hunted by humans for their use in sushi and other food products. Because of this demand, the Bluefin Tuna has become the most valuable animal on the planet. To see one underwater however, is to witness the perfection of nature. They have evolved to encompass a hydrodynamic design, with powerful musculature and a biology capable of generating heat within their bodies. \nAtlantic Bluefin Tuna continue to grow for their entire lives, crossing entire oceans in the course of a year and swimming faster than a torpedo. No land animal possesses such superlatives, yet because Bluefin are fish, they are often seen only as food.\n\n@natgeocreative @thephotosociety\n\n#bluefin #tuna #underwater #photography #nature #nationalgeographic #natgeo #canada #stlawrence #gulf #photo #photooftheday #onassignment #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador #nikonlove",

Leatherbacks are known to feed almost exclusively on jellyfish, but I found this turtle ‘trying something new’ during a chance encounter while on assignment searching for tuna. \nThese ancient mariners have a lineage that dates back more than 100 million years yet, despite having dwelled for so long, today these creatures face substantial threats from anthropogenic stresses. Fishing accidents and climate change continue to harm the global population of these turtles, given that the temperature of eggs  determines the sex of hatchlings, and conservation efforts are necessary to protect these animals in the future. \nOnce the baby turtles reach the ocean after hatching, the leatherback is in perpetual motion and continues to swim for its entire life.\n\n@natgeocreative @thephotosociety\n\n#leatherback #turtle #sea #azores #atlantic #nature #photography #national #geographic #natgeo #nationalgeographic #underwater #photography #turtles #cute #animals #nature #photooftheday #conservation #preservation #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador #nikonlove",

Due to their remoteness, ecosystems such as this one have remained largely unspoiled by human activity, and we can use their preserved status to understand how healthy coral reefs truly function when untouched by anthropogenic influence. Kingman Reef is under the jurisdiction of the United States and was protected as a marine reserve by President George W. Bush in 2007, prior to his leaving office.\n\nScientists state that, in order for our planet to stay healthy, at least 30% of the ocean must be protected, yet today only about 3% has been conserved. To learn more about oceanic conservation efforts, and to see more underwater photography, follow me, @BrianSkerry, on Instagram. \nPhotographed on assignment for @NatGeo Magazine. \n@natgeocreative @thephotosociety\n\n#kingmanreef #reef #coralreef #tropical #underwater #photography #photooftheday #nature #coral #nationalgeographic #natgeo #preservation #conservation #hawaii #pacific #onassignment #followme #nikonlove #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador",

      "description": "Photo by @BrianSkerry. \nA harp seal pup, about 5 to 7 days old,  has fallen through the thin ice of Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence. Its mother frantically tries to help the pup to the surface in order to breathe, and to get back on stable ice. Harp seal pups need a stable platform of solid ice from which to suckle from their moms, building up weight and strength. They only require about 2 weeks to do so, but if the ice is thin, then can fall into the frigid sea before they are ready and die. \nClimate change in recent years has produced thinning ice and during certain years, there has been no ice at all. This loss of sea ice has created a serious problem, leading to high pup mortality rates for this species. Seeing such events while on assignment has affected me greatly, and in the years since making this photo I have continued to see the devastating effects of climate change worldwide. \nFor the 10th anniversary of Earth Hour, I’m joining the #MakeClimateMatter online community. Earth Hour is the world’s biggest movement for action on climate change. \nI hope you’ll sign up to take part on March 25 at 8.30pm at wwf.org.uk/earthhour\n\n#earthhour #harp #seal #pup #underwater #photography #climate #change #protect #preserve #climatechange #globalwarming",

Caught by surface currents, many of these squid and wash on to the dark, volcanic, sandy beaches of Toyama Bay. The blue light is from photo cells on the squid's tentacles, which glow with luminescence before they die.  Photographed on assignment for @NatGeo Magazine.  #japan #squid #firefly #night #photography#toyama #bay #underwater #natgeo#nationalgeographic #onassignment#photooftheday #conservation #nikonlove #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador",
