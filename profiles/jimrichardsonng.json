It was formed in 1823, mostly to preserve Highland dress and the Gaelic language (among others,) it harks back to an even earlier era when one of the main products of the Highlands was soldiers for the Scottish Regiments. It’s always the fourth Saturday of August and, to me, one of the finest of the games to be seen. There’s much more in our story on the Scottish Moors in the may issue of National Geographic. @natgeo @natgeocreative #scotland #lonach #lonachgames",

Our story in the May issue of National Geographic explores both the scenic wonders and the making of these lands, which owe as much to man-made influences as to nature. Even here you can see the stripes in the heather indicating that gamekeepers have been doing their jobs, burning the heather so that rich regrowth can nurture the red grouse. And tucked into the valleys are tree farms, a controversial land use in Scotland. But the hills themselves are magnificent and I was luck to see it that morning. #Scotland @natgeocreative #nature @natgeo",

It’s very old, of course, some of it going back to 1100 BC, maybe. But it never had a water supply so you can’t see how defenders would withstand a siege for long. I appreciate that they still haven’t built a fence along the cliff edge. It’s extremely scary but also thrilling. Nobody falls off. @natgeo @natgeocreative #ireland",

But there was also a proliferation of building in the last several centuries as families grew and fields were sub-divided and then divided again. The construction is drystane, meaning that there is no mortar used, so a great deal of skill is involved if they are to last. They are also constructed so the wind can pass through some, otherwise the fierce Atlantic gales would tear them down. It’s an inspiring place for a nonconformist like me. @natgeo @natgeocreative #ireland",

      "description": "Looking down on Irishman (Inis Meáin) in the Aran Islands (Irish: Oileáin Árann) you can connect the Iron Age with the modern world and see many of the steps in between.  Dún Chonchúir (Conor's Fort) is a ringfort started in pre-Christian times that is now surrounded by a maze of stone walls dividing fields and pastures. You can see how the road veered around as life developed in one continuous process from then till now.  And it’s quite possible that local folk living there now carry the genes of their ancestors who built the place. @natgeo @natgeocreative #ireland #history",
