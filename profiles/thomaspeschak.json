      "description": "Waved albatrosses appear as mirror images of one another on Española in the Galápagos—a World Heritage Site since 1979. In a choreographed mating ritual, these goose-sized sea birds use their beaks to repeatedly gape, point and fence. Photographing critically endangered animals like the waved albatross is both a privilege and a burden. As a photographer, how can I best capture the beauty and wonder of an animal in a way that takes people’s breath away? How can I create images that foster awareness and appreciation, which ultimately leads to conservation action?\n\nShot on assignment for @natgeo magazine for a forthcoming story on climate change and the Galápagos Islands.

These tiny freeloaders can collectively add around 1,000 extra pounds to the whales. However, for these 45-ton giants, it’s no big deal. The spot along British Columbia’s “nook & cranny” coast is a magnet for humpback whales, fin whales and orcas. First Nations peoples and other conservation organizations have negotiated with the government for decades to conserve this special place. While 15% of the Great Bear Rainforest forest is sustainably managed for logging, the remaining 85% is protected, giving everything from humpbacks to barnacles safe harbor. \n@pacificwild #GreatBearRainforest #Canada #BritishColumbia #whales",

The juxtaposition of marine biodiversity and industry on the high seas encapsulates the dangers of climate change on our marine ecosystems.\n\nWhile natural gas is cleaner burning than coal, predicted CO2 emissions will still remain too high to prevent ocean acidification, sea level rise, disruption of upwelling currents and generally warmer seawater temperatures. All of which can negatively impact on the health and ecology of ocean wildlife.\n\nOnly by embracing renewable energy sources (solar, wind, tides, waves, geothermal) will we be able to ensure that our oceans remain healthy and thus in turn continue to sustain humanity on our blue planet. \nFor the 10th anniversary of Earth Hour, I’m joining the #MakeClimateMatter online community.  Earth Hour is the world’s biggest movement for action on climate change.

      "description": "African Black Oystercatchers breed during the height of South Africa’s summer. They lay their eggs in a shallow scrape in the sand or on bare rocks, making them vulnerable to human disturbance. A 4x4 off-road beach-driving ban in 2002 has alleviated much of the stress on the oystercatcher populations. The waiting game for this photograph lasted hours until the tide was just right. This pair arrived to feed on the wave washed rocks just as I was on the verge of giving up. Malgas Island, West Coast National Park, South Africa.  #wowsouthafrica",

      "description": "There are few places on this planet where dramatic waterfalls pour directly into the ocean. Waterfall Bluff on the Wild Coast of South Africa is one of them. During the rainy season strands of rivers on the coastal platform braid together and race towards the Indian Ocean. Whether you hike to the base of the falls or opt for an aerial experience, this natural wonder is a reminder of the importance of protected areas. Waterfall Bluff, Wild Coast, Eastern Cape, South Africa. #wowsouthafrica",

      "description": "Every winter southern right whales arrive along the South African coast to mate and give birth. The De Hoop Marine Reserve is the most important southern right whale sanctuary in Africa and is a real highlight to visit. Up to 350 whales have been known to frequent this protected area at any one time. To get this shot I joined nature conservation officials in a small helicopter to survey marine wildlife from the air.
