Every one has a place in the environment that they're best adapted to. Everything is linked to make ecosystems healthy and functioning. Every species that is lost, weakens our very own grasp on survival. So let us celebrate all the wildlife out there and work towards a world that is more inclusive of species other than our own - because, ultimately we depend on them. Happy World Wildlife Day. #worldwildlifeday",

Lions are affectionate and will constantly reinforce their heir bonds through touch but it appears that these two are particularly close. In an uncertain and dangerous world it benefits these cats to work together to increase their hunting success and hold on to a territory. It may surprise you however, that our little house cats also display a great deal of very lion-like behaviour.

They can turn a garden into a jungle and pounce on swaying leaves and run up trees. Our pets have not lost the instincts that have made them so successful in the wild. They will always retain their inner 'big cat'. Look out for Soul of the Cat this Big Cat Week on Nat Geo Wild to explore these similarities. #soulofthecat #bigcatweek #littlebigcats",

      "description": "A young lion drinks deeply after a successful hunt on an exceptionally hot day in the Selinda Reserve in Botswana. He is one of 6 cubs - all of whom have been successfully raised to this age; a most unusual occurrence. There was a day in their young lives when we weren't sure that they would all make it. They were being guided by their two mothers across a deep channel as small cubs, when two panicked and turned back. The lionesses swam between their cubs for the rest of the day, trying to coax the scared two into swimming back to the others. Scared of crocodiles and hippos, they refused and eventually spent a long and undoubtedly nervous night on their own. At first light the following morning, the lionesses appeared again and this time the cubs had little hesitation in hanging on and swimming the channel to join their siblings. Now this young male is at an age when he is about to head off on his own and try his luck as an adult. With the strong lessons he would have learned from those determined lionesses, his chances may possibly be better than others of the same age. #bigcats #selindapride #lions #thisismytrophy",
