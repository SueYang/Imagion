Six photographs that give us an intimate insight into both his professional approach to his art and his passion for these magnificent creatures.\n\"In 2014, @jemcresswell set out to spend time with humpback whales during their annual migration to their breeding grounds in Tonga. The artist was initially drawn to the whales for the subject‚Äôs sheer size and gentle nature and he has continued to return to Tonga, over three years, to capture intimate underwater visions of these complex and conscious animals. The resulting photographs are nothing short of spectacular.\"\nWe are good friends of Jem and can vouch that his atttention to detail does not leave a single pixel unaccounted for, this is ocean art! üëåüèºüêã we'll be sharing more soon.. but click the link in our bio for the rest of the series.",

That teach us how to love, how to be kind, what to say to someone when they have lost a loved one. \nWe don't fully understand by listening or reading, but by being exposed and getting involved. The most touching moments of my life have been so subtle and small. \nA tiny, violet flower on top of a mountain, a snowfall in a field of red clover, a smile from a little old lady, a sunrise, a shooting stars.\nIt's listening to someone's story and seeing the beauty in their bruises and scars. It's learning the truth even when it's disturbing and easier to ignore. Having the courage to do what's right even when it's so hard to face the things you can't believe are true. We have a responsibility to fight for the things we love, like this little seal that swam with me. It's uncomfortable to change when you get use to something you like, but if that thing you like is causing suffering and harm to another living being is it worth it? I understand how it's overwhelming to hear all the problems we face as a whole planet today, but every little action helps. Times are changing, people are waking up, once we know the truth it's our obligation to make a difference\" üíú#evolving #marinewildlife #protectwhereyouplay#stopsucking #keepthemwild #madeofocean #seals\nPhoto ¬© Morgan lee Alain @morganleealain",
