      "description": "Confluence, Canyonlands Utah. \nI've photographed the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers in Canyonlands National Park a lot in my career. Funny thing is that the best image I've ever made of it was with a smartphone. When I made this smartphone picture I realized that much in photography had changed. Good pictures were no longer going to be the exclusive domain of high-end cameras and professional photographers. Smartphones had come of age. They democratized photography! A photographer still has to know where and when to point the camera but the camera itself was no longer a huge factor. In the intervening years telephone cameras have only gotten better.\n\nI'd like to know what people think about the smartphone's influence on photography. Opinions??? #utah #canyonlands #smartphone",

      "description": "Barrier Canyon Style rock art is among the most beautiful and enigmatic in the world. Years ago, as a young photographer I used to roam the American west seaking things to photograph. At a teacher's suggestion I began looking at Barrier Canyon sites in Utah. The images simultaneously scared, inspired and enchanted me. 20+ years later I am still working on the subject! You can follow my progress at the Ancient Art Archive. There is a live link in my profile that takes you to the support page (@salvarezphoto)\n#utah #barriercanyon #rockart",
