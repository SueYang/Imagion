Corroded by currents and waves, small icebergs like this one, serve as perches on which wildlife, including penguins, seals, and seabirds, from which hunting, mating , nursing and breeding all take place.

      "description": "Shadows dance across the frozen landscape as a pod of Antarctic Minke whales travels along the face of a massive glacier. Minkes, the third smallest of the baleen whales, were largely spared by the whaling industry due to their small size.  As a result, they once were the most abundant baleen whale in the world.  In the past 40 years, however, they became the target of whalers in countries like Brazil and South Africa and more recently, they have been hunted by the Japanese Antarctic whaling fleet,  which hunts them under the guise of a very controversial “scientific research” scheme.  I am sure most people would join me in voicing a desire for these whales to be left alone and for the long overdue end of the whaling era. #OnAssignment for @NatGeo and @NatGeoPristineSeas with @PaulNicklen, @Ladzinski, @Andy_Mann and @SeaLegacy. *\n*\n*\n#stopwhaling #oceans #PhotographerforAntarctica #whales #love #respectnature #picoftheday #expeditionscouncil",

      "description": "Adelie penguins may spend hours stacked together on blocks of floating ice, just waiting for the right moment to forage. Ice is their perch, their safe haven from predators, their launch pad. But ice, especially sea ice formed by frozen ocean water, also is essential for krill, staple of the penguin diet. Here near the eastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, ice often remains thick through summer. But travel across the Antarctic Sound to the western peninsula and ocean circulation and wind patterns are different. There, temperatures warming extremely fast, rapidly melting ice. And there, Adelie populations in many places have dropped by more than half in 30 years.\n #onassignment for @natgeo with @paulnicklen, @ladzinski, @andy_mann.

      "description": "While I pondered how best to convey the ethereal quality of the slow-moving parade of icebergs flowing across this bay, I felt lucky to share the scene with my teammate on this assignment, @Ladzsinki,a photographer whose style I have long admired. We stood in the cold, shallow waters of this bay for hours, watching the gathering clouds of the approaching storm. The dreamy results barely do justice to the beauty of the Antarctic landscape, but will hopefully inspire action to protect this important and fragile ecosystem.  #OnAssignment for @NatGeo with @PaulNicklen, @Ladzinski, @Andy_Mann, and @CraigWelch @pattersonimages @sonyalpha @natgeocreative @natgeopristineseas @NatgeoPristineSeas, @SeaLegacy @Natgeocreative #beauty #gratitude #ocean #CCAMLR2018 #PhotographersforAntarctica #landscape #picoftheday",

      "description": "A baby elephant seal, or \"weaner\", sits alone on a beach on the Antarctic Peninsula.  After suckling her pup for about twenty-eight days, the mother elephant seal shuts off the supply of rich milk. The mother weans her pup abruptly so that she can return to the sea and replenish her depleted nutritional supplies after having fasted since coming ashore to give birth. In so doing, she will leave her pup, now re-named ' weaner ', to fend for itself on the beach. Over the next two to three months, as the weaners spend more and more time in the water, they venture further and further away from their home shore. Sometimes, they get caught up in the ocean currents and have to come ashore on different beaches to rest. #OnAssignment for @NatGeo, @NatGeoPristineSeas and @SeaLegacy.

As a faint opalescent moon heralds twilight, we marvel on the intricate designs that the tides, the wind and the sea have carved on this piece of ice. I could tell you a thousand reasons why healthy ice in Antarctica is important but sometimes, you just have to marvel at the beauty of nature and be grateful that it still exists on our planet.

      "description": "From the time they are born until they become independent, baby humpbacks depend on their mothers not just for food and protection, but also for experience on how to survive.  Mothers and calves spend several months in the warm waters of the Silver Bank off the coast of the Dominican Republic where, in the sheltered waters of this maze of reefs and shallow banks, the babies can gain the coordination and strength they will need for the enormous migrations they will need to make to their feeding grounds in the summer.  As mom “trains” baby on how to swim, float and fend for itself, the two often touch, snuggle and when baby gets tired, it sits on its mother’s back to rest on the surface.  It is hard to articulate the privilege it is to be in the water with a massive humpback mom and for her to feel confident enough to allow us to swim so close to her calf.  So much we can learn from nature!!
