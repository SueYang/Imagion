      "description": "Just one more shot of these delicious waffles and chocolat eggs from Easterüíõüê£Yesterday I found out that there might be an explination for the drop of likes and followers on IG the last month and the answer is shadow banning. In short terms int means that accounts that don't follow you won't see your work under all of the hashtags you've been using. IG admits that it's happening but they won't tell why or how they've changed this. So you can be shadow banned and I got shadow banned. Check out this website to see if you're: http://shadowban.azurewebsites.net/. It could also mean that IG can't handle all the traffic with 500 M users or there is a bug in their system. There are accounts that benefits from placering their tags in their caption instead of first comment, don't use tags that are banned by IG, don't be to aktive with likes and comments or you might be mistanken for a not, stop buying followers + likes and finally stop using IG for 48 hours. Well, I don't know; I've actually been accepting less likes and that I stopped gain followers anymore because there is nothing that I can do about it. Instead I'm concentrated about my passion for styling, shooting, my own personal nordic style and last but not least about enjoying all your gorgeous images dear dudes. The social part of IG means the most for me; new inspiring and enrichment relations makes the difference in my life. Have a lovely day dear dudesüòò\n#feedfeed #foodandwine #design #danishdesign #nordicinspiration #waffles #morningslikethese #interior",
