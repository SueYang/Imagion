      "description": "Endangered Laos warty newts at the @rivermuseum in Dubuque, Iowa. \nThis species lives only in the Northern mountainous areas of Laos. They are mostly aquatic and thrive in streams and pools at high elevations. The main threat to this species is collection and exportation into the international pet trade in Germany and Japan. Since these animals have brightly colored markings and are active during the day, they aren’t difficult to locate and it’s possible for collectors to spot and grab up each and every mature individual to be taken from one site in just a few days, wiping out a local population. Since such a large number can be taken at once, they are often sold in large groups by the kilogram. The Laos warty newt was listed in 2008 as a Category I species in the Lao WIldlife and Aquatic Law, which means all commercial trade of this species is prohibited. So, some protection is possible at least, given proper law enforcement.\n.\n.\n#laos #laoswartynewts #newt #rare #rareanimals #notapet #wildlife #wildlifephotography #photoark #natgeo",

These lemurs are very clean and spend a large amount of time grooming themselves with their specialized incisor teeth, hind claws, and tongues- which are colored black. They live in matriarchal groups and forage for food together during the abundant wet season. Unlike most lemurs, red ruffed lemurs will often divide and find food on their own during the dry season. \nRed ruffed lemurs live in a very small range in the forests of northern Madagascar and are threatened by the huge surge of illegal rosewood logging that began after an undemocratic change in political power in the area in 2009. These lemurs are also threatened by hunting, burning of habitat, the illegal pet trade, and frequent cyclones.\nTo see a full length image of a red ruffed lemur check out @natgeo!\n.\n.\n#redruffedlemur #lemurs #cuteanimals #notapet #wildlifephotography #wildlife #photoark #natgeo",

Indeed, they are grand champion hibernators, sleeping up to seven months a year or more. \"You could put people into hibernation for space trips if you could understand it better,\" said Franziska 'Fran' Kohl, one of the biologists here. \"They also show symptoms of Alzheimer's during hibernation.\"\nThis cold-weather rodent is also the only mammal that can drop its body temperature to below freezing. Most impressively, it can completely heal traumatic brain injuries while hibernating. Biologists at UAF have been studying this species for more than 20 years, but many mysteries still remain.\n.\n.\n#arcticgroundsquirrel #squirrels #hibernation #Alaska #arctic #squirrels #mammals #cuteanimals #fluffy #cute #wildlife #photoark #natgeo",

      "description": "A panther chameleon at the @lincolnchildrenszoo. \nOver time, chameleons’ five toes have evolved into a fused pair of two and three, leaving feet that are perfect for clutching onto the branches they live on. Their eyes move independently from one another, allowing a 360 degree view of the world around them. Chameleons are very territorial, living in isolation with the exception of mating. If two males cross paths, it’s common for them to have a standoff wherein they both change colors and make themselves appear larger by inflating their bodies. Usually, these displays end with one of the two backing down, and changing into a dark, dull color. \nChameleons change colors depending on mood, light and temperature. It’s a common misconception that chameleons can change into any color under the sun. Species are born with a certain range of colors and are unable to stray from those. Panther chameleons have been known to exhibit some of the most vibrant variations.\nTo see a video of this chameleon, check out @natgeo!\n.\n.\n#pantherchameleon #reptiles #herps #chameleon #natgeo #photoark",

Restrictions on the hide trade and habitat preservation measures have kept the alligator, a survivor of some 180 to 200 million years, alive and well. \nIt is no exaggeration to say that saving the biodiversity of Earth is now a matter of life and death for all of us. The vibrancy of plant and animal life, from the tropical forests to the seas, is what sustains us. We must have a healthy planet to stay healthy ourselves. The good news is that we can and will save the things we care most about.
