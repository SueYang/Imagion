      "description": "Photo by @TimLaman.  Costa’s Hummingbird female feeding baby in her nest, photographed yesterday in the Palm Springs Airport.  Yes, that’s right, IN the airport, which is largely open air.  I don’t usually get my wildlife photography tips from United Airlines staff, but at check-in, when I was asked about all my gear and mentioned I was a wildlife photographer, a helpful agent told me of a hummingbird nest in a cactus on the way to my gate.  Score one point for UA!  Sure enough, there it was, and it just required a 15 min wait for the female to arrive for a feeding session.  I was glad that though I have to check a lot of my gear, I always have a core set of equipment in my carry-on so that in case I arrive somewhere and my luggage is delayed I can start shooting.  The ironic thing is that for the past several days shooting birds in the wild, I’d been hoping to find an active hummingbird nest without success…. until the airport.  Mommy hummingbird looked like she was just pumping nectar into baby.  Pretty cool.  To give you a sense of the size of these tiny birds, if I put a US Quarter coin in there, I could cover the baby with it.  #PalmSprings, #Hummingbird, @thephotosociety, @natgeocreative.",

A Great Hornbill takes off and flies perfectly through an opening in the tree crown on a misty afternoon in the rain forest of Southern Thailand.  @NatGeo photo assistant @DrewFulton and I spent many afternoons at spectacular forest lookouts attempting to capture Helmeted Hornbills, the endangered species that is our main focus.  We had little luck with them, but photographed several other hornbill species like this Great Hornbill found in this rich #rainforest.  Still frame from RED Epic-W camera at 75fps, which allowed me to capture the bird in the exact right position.  @reddigitalcinema, #ShotonRED, #Hornbills, #Thailand, @thephotosociety, @natgeocreative.",

Field camp on assignment for @NatGeo in Southern Thailand where we have been searching for Helmeted Hornbills.  @NatGeo team member @DrewFulton and Thailand Hornbill Project team sit down to dinner. Ironically, our campsite high up the mountain in the rain forest is a former illegal logging camp, where the wood left behind forms nice benches, but is a stark reminder that these birds habitat is slowly getting degraded, even in protected areas.  Thailand Hornbill Project is working hard to try to save hornbills across the region.  I’ll share more Behind-the-Scenes shots here over the coming days so you can see what goes into doing the kind of wildlife photography I do.  #Hornbills, #Thailand, @thephotosociety, @natgeocreative",

I’ve been in the field these recent weeks pursuing the critically endangered Helmeted Hornbill for @NatGeo with @DrewFulton and the team from the Thailand Hornbill Project. Sometimes in wildlife photography, you don’t get what you are after, but some other nice opportunities arise.  I was hoping for Helmeted’s to come to this fig, and spent several mornings in a blind in the canopy, but this Rhinoceros Hornbill showed up instead!  Can’t complain – one of the most awesome birds of SE Asia.
