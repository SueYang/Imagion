      "description": "The edge of shrinking, frozen world: Today many of my friends and colleagues are marching for science. I‚Äôve spent years working on the front lines of climate change seeing rivers dry, glaciers dwindle and our frozen realms shrink.  The science explaining this rapid rate of change is agreed upon by 97% of planets scientific leaders and yes, we are playing a hand in it, all of us, myself included. It shouldn‚Äôt be political though.  It should simply be a call to change, to find solutions and innovations together to protect this beautiful blue sphere we all share. Thanks for the leadership @jeremyjones @protectourwinters #climatechange #climatemarch #antarctica #scienceisreal #keepparis #noplanetb üì∑ @pedromcbride",

More info in bio link.\nFor many Navajo, Hopi,  canyon lovers and others, this image is a sacred landscape, a natural church, believed to be best left for nature. For others, it is the best place for a 1.4-mile-long tramway into the heart of the Grand Canyon, carrying up to 10,000 people a day.  The economics and philosophy of this proposal, have divided the Navajo nation around it which is planning a vote on the project ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. Native Navajo Jason Nez, standing in the image, is fighting to keep the landscape undeveloped, but he is also acutely aware of the economic drought his nation faces. He wants to find economic alternatives. #chasingrivers #grandcanyon #nature #navajo #confluence üì∑#petemcbride thx for support  @hyperlite_mountain_gear @goalzero @4cornerfilmlogistics @delormegps",

Well, because it the world‚Äôs longest river and such a journey by foot had never been done. How he did it is another question. All I know is I got to follow him for a couple weeks through inky, mysterious waters, nervous about what lurked below. Despite a close encounter with a 10-foot electric eel, little happened beyond a few hundred bug bites, lots of thorns and some blisters. #MattPower, the talented writer that joined me (left of image), tragically passed away on another story walking another river, the Nile.
