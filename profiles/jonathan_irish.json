Located along the main road about 9 miles from the entrance, the precarious nature of this rock perched so delicately upon the underlying rock is hard to miss. Anytime is a great time to photograph and explore this cool rock, but I particularly love the moment when the sun just dips below the horizon and the the world is awash in a golden hue. •\nArches National Park (50 of 59)\n•\nShot with FUJIFILM X-T1 and XF100-400 F4.5-5.6 lens\n•\n#59in52 #onassignment #NPS100 @natgeocreative @fujifilmUS @fujifilmx_us #fujifilmx_us #myfujifilm #myinstax #XT1 @instax @airstream_inc @natgeo @visitutah",

      "description": "I'm really excited to start sharing images from one of my favorite parks to photograph, Arches National Park in #Utah. I've photographed in Arches many times, so I know it well. It's not a big park, and everything is pretty easily accessed, so it is a ton of fun to be there with a camera. There are great shots and vantage points at almost every turn, but I always try to find new ones with each visit. This shot, of Delicate Arch, is from across the canyon looking back the Arch. It's not an altogether unique view, but the combination of a long lens and good timing when a visitor was walking makes it a cool shot. The southwest U.S. is one of my favorite places in the world to photograph and I can't wait to share more from Arches, Canyonlands, and then Bryce Canyon. It's gonna be goood. •\nArches National Park (50 of 59)\n•\nShot with FUJIFILM X-T1 and XF100-400 F4.5-5.6 lens\n•\n#59in52 #onassignment #NPS100 @natgeocreative @fujifilmUS @fujifilmx_us #fujifilmx_us #myfujifilm #myinstax #XT1 @instax @airstream_inc @natgeo @visitutah",

      "description": "I think people often overlook the cool things that can be found just outside of the national parks. For instance, we found this really cool volcanic plug, nicknamed The Needle, outside of Black Canyon of the Gunnison. A \"plug\" is a volcanic object that is created when magma hardens within a vent of an active volcano. This one stands about 800 feet tall and was formed some 28 million years ago. This is a pretty neat thing to stumble upon when playing around in the parks. It serves as a good reminder to keep your eyes peeled and always be open to new and different exploration. You just may find something really cool. •\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison National Park (49 of 59)\n•\nShot with FUJIFILM X-T1 and XF50-140mm F2.8 lens\n•\n#59in52 #onassignment #NPS100 #ColoradoLive @VisitColorado @natgeocreative @fujifilmUS @fujifilmx_us #fujifilmx_us #myfujifilm #myinstax #XT1 @instax @airstream_inc",

However, every once in a while we'd come upon one that just confounded me as to how they not only built these houses in the crevices, but climbed to them carrying food, water, and even children in their backs. Turns out, they carved footholds and handholds into the rock walls that allowed them to scramble up and down vertical cliffs. I think I too would rest pretty soundly at night knowing what any visitors/enemies had to go through just to reach my house. I may, however, have nightmares from time to time thinking about climbing down the walls! •\nMesa Verde National Park (48 of 59)\n•\nShot with FUJIFILM X-T1 and XF100-400 F4.5-5.6 lens\n•\n#59in52 #onassignment #NPS100 #ColoradoLive @VisitColorado @natgeocreative @fujifilmUS @fujifilmx_us #fujifilmx_us #myfujifilm #myinstax #XT1 @instax @airstream_inc",

      "description": "Kiva is a Hopi word meaning \"ceremonial room\". The Kiva is roughly the ancestral puebloan equivalent to today's temple, synagogue, mosque, or church. All Kivas have a small hole near the firepit, called a Sipapu, which a Hopi word which means \"place of emergence\". It was believed that this small hole was a gateway to the spiritual world. Most of the Kivas you'll see at Mesa Verde are round in shape. However, at one of the Far View sites (Coyote Village along the top of the Mesa) you can find this really interesting keyhole shape. Nobody really knows why the keyhole shape came about just in this one complex, nor why it didn't continue as they later moved down below the cliffs. What's your theory why they used this keyhole shape for a brief moment in time?\n•\nMesa Verde National Park (48 of 59)\n•\nShot with FUJIFILM X-T1 and XF16-55mm F2.8 lens\n•\n#59in52 #onassignment #NPS100 #ColoradoLive @VisitColorado @natgeocreative @fujifilmUS @fujifilmx_us #fujifilmx_us #myfujifilm #myinstax #XT1 @instax @airstream_inc",

      "description": "Mesa Verde, in southwest Colorado, blew me away. Home to some 600 or so Ancestral Puebloan cliff dwellings that were inhabited from AD 600 to 1300, I had no idea the extent nor the beauty of these cultural wonders. Most of the dwellings contains less than 5 rooms, but the masterpiece of the national park lies in the huge dwelling called Cliff Palace. The largest cliff dwelling in North America, Cliff Palace has 150 rooms, 23 Kivas (underground ceremonial pits), and housed approximately 100 people. It was a thriving community in its heyday and when you walk among the ruins you can still feel their haunting presence and experience what it must have been like to live here. Truly an incredible place. •\nMesa Verde National Park (48 of 59)\n•\nShot with FUJIFILM X-T1 and XF16-55mm F2.8 lens\n•\n#59in52 #onassignment #NPS100 #ColoradoLive @VisitColorado @natgeocreative @fujifilmUS @fujifilmx_us #fujifilmx_us #myfujifilm #myinstax #XT1 @instax @airstream_inc",

This one, at Great Sand Dunes NP, will be one of the more memorable. Sleeping under the stars while tucked into the high dunes was just so great. We watched in awe as the sun went down, made a backpacker dinner while digging our toes into the sand, had a sip (or several) of whiskey as the stars started to dance in the sky, slept like babies on the soft sand, and woke up for a blissful sunrise with a cup of coffee in hand, all with the one you love.
