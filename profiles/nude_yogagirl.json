      "description": "I miss him so much. We've been in different places for a few weeks now and I already feel that I would do anything just so I could hug him. I've never been so close with anyone else. He knows me better than I do and I trust him more than I ever thought is possible.\n‚ù§Ô∏è\nI think that we have to make ourselves happy by ourself - we can't expect others to have such a big responsibility. I believe this relationship couldn't be that balanced and equal if we both wouldn't have our own life and selfrespect too. But I feel that without him something is missing. I would like to share everything with him.\n‚ù§ \nHe is my soulmate, I knew it immediately three years ago. But he has become my best fried and business partner too. This journey together with NYG has also been challenging, but working together becomes easier all the time. It has been amazing to share all the experiences together.\n‚ù§ \nI'm very grateful for him and how much he has supported me and put effort in everything as well. When we started I was so controlling when he had the camera in his hand, but nowadays I think he is a photographer too. He is the one who I want the most in the world to take pictures of me.\n‚ù§\nHe is the best. And missing someone can hurt but it's also a very beautiful thing. I appreciate that there is a man who makes me feel this way. üòâ",

I want to be a person who is enthusiastic because that affects others and I think it's a big power of life. I'm happy that I've found many things which make me enthusiastic and that I can follow a path and dreams which make me excited about the future!\n‚ù§Ô∏è\nE would be also eBooks. I found them just about a year ago, but nowadays I like to listen books when I clean up or do other homework. Also when I'm travelling. Mainly I listen different biographies and nonfiction books.\n‚ù§ \nAnd E would be Energy. That's the biggest motivation to me for a healthy lifestyle and eat well. I want to have energy to chase my dreams and do things which make me happy. ‚ù§",

      "description": "Someone who is struggling with overweight asked me a few days ago assuming... \"It takes a lot of work to stay in the condition that you are, right?\" I was thinking right away, no! üòä\n‚ù§Ô∏è\nI'm not in any fitness condition at all or even in fashion model measures anymore (and it doesn¬¥t bother me, I wouldn't be willing to sacrifice what it requires) but I'm feeling that I'm in the best condition of my life. I may not be just today, but generally in the last 2 years. I'm feeling good, I sleep well, my metabolism works, I'm not stressed by weight, my weight stays about the same, even though I haven't been weighing myself for years or restricting my eating almost at all. I'm happy with myself and I can enjoy the food and the life I love.\n‚ù§Ô∏è\nOf course, all of those go hand by hand, but the point is that I've put the least effort in staying in shape during the last couple of years. I haven't performed health at all, I haven't been hungry, I haven't felt bad because of anything I've eaten, I haven't forced myself to train if I'm tired.\n‚ù§Ô∏è\nWhen you find balance, treasure it. It took many years for me to find it, because I tried all different kinds of strict diets. They mixed my metabolism and hormone functions. If you eat too long too little and irregularly, it can slow down your metabolism. And I've been in that vicious circle. I can't recommend it. So forget diets and choose a permanently healthy and flexible lifestyle! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòò",

      "description": "I'm used to live in uncertainty. I think many of us do because of different reasons: money situations, diseases, temporary work, no work... I mainly because of places where I'm living/working and traveling. For¬†the last ten years I've lived month by month almost all the time - many times day by day too. People may think how exciting when your future is so open, when anything can happen. Yes, I like it mostly too and it was my choice.\n‚ù§ \nBut I can tell it's also annoying and worrying sometimes because you never know where you're going to be and it's hard to plan anything with others. It's also always packing, actually many times I'm unpacking and packing again at the same time. And it's not easy to make a home and routines and friends when you don't spend enough time for that.\n‚ù§ \nI try to enjoy situations and mostly I think \"It's not like this for an eternity.\" I guess?! But today I got reminded that sometimes I just have to make decisions, like in the morning when I booked flight tickets for this weekend. I thought about this already for weeks: Where I'm going and when, for how long I'm going to stay etc.. This takes a lot of energy and time especially because I change my mind all the time.\n‚ù§ \nMaking decisions is a good skill. I think things happen when the time is right and we can trust also the unknow. But I can't be passive. Usually I listen to my intuition and trust what it says. But sometimes it says nothing, like today. I don't know if I made a good decision but I think the main thing was to make one. Now I feel good because I don't have to think anymore about what to do. Maybe we just have to make decisions even if we aren't 100% sure?!\n‚ù§Ô∏è",

I don't want to go the easiest way in life, I want to learn all the time. So here are my 3 most important skills which I'm going to improve at.\n‚ù§ \n1. English. Absolutely! There are still lot of things to do to get my English more fluent. (keeping my account has improved my writing skills a lot.) I also want to learn one more language so I want to improve and get more courage to speak different languages.\n‚ù§ \n2. Yoga and meditation. You can't really get ready with them... And I want to improve my skills with these two through my whole life with! For example I want to get better in bringing deep breaths and presence to my everyday life I want also to get better at all arm balance asanas.\n‚ù§ \n3. Photographing and especially finding my own strong style. Of course, I feel that I own a style already and have found it but as an artist I always question it. I doubt my choiches and try different things because there are so many ways to do photos. I want to improve my eye, skills and view endlessly. I still think I'm in the beginning even if I trust myself more than ever when photographing.\n‚ù§ \nWhat skills do you want to improve?üòä\n‚ù§\nThank you @lifestyleretreats for the beautiful stay.\n#PassionforLife\n#TheBal√©NusaDua",

      "description": "#NudeYogaGirlAlphabet D= Dream, Different, Dance and Dessert.‚ù§ In the alphabet of my life D would be Dream. One of my mottos has been for years \"If you can dream it, you can do it.\" And I think dreaming is very important. I hope all of you have a dream or dreams.\n‚ù§ \nD would be also Different. Because I have understood that being different and unique is our power, our richness. I really hope the world would be more tolerant for difference but I also hope that every single one of us could accept themselves exactly the way they are.\n‚ù§ \nAnd the last D would be Dance and Dessert. I love both!!! In life we need those. For balance, for joy, to celebrate how amazing this life actually is. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

      "description": "I think I've never told you my story, how I ended up here‚Ä¶ So today I want to tell you something about my studying. How school isn't the only way. Passion, believing in yourself and hard work can take you there. This is my life, not anyone elses, I remember thinking when I made the decision that wasn't the most usual when I was 22 years old...\n‚ù§Ô∏è\nI have noticed that many people nowadays are very lost about what they want to be and who they are. I was there, that's also very ok. There are so many choices, but also so many expectations. I was so lost about what I wanted to do for my profession and what to study... that it made me almost sick. I felt that I'm not good enough in anything, not one particular thing where I would be extra talented or extra interested in. But I knew that inside me there is a lot of energy if I just find the correct way to channel it.\n‚ù§Ô∏è\nYou may be surprised that I have never studied anything that I directly need for my work nowadays. Not photographing, not nutrition, holistic wellbeing, fashion or writing. Not teaching yoga, not marketing or anything else commercial‚Ä¶ At least not at school or courses. By myself, yes. A lot, very much by myself.\n‚ù§Ô∏è\nWhat have I studied then? I'm 27, so yes I have been in university and other schools. I've studied the following three: industrial designing, philosophy and sociology. Actually I have always been ‚Äùthe school girl‚Äù. The one who got excellent grades, and who thought studying is very important. It is, I still think that. But you can study things by yourself. Being curious and interested in learning is the most important thing. I liked my studies but they weren't my thing.\n‚ù§Ô∏è\nI'm happy that I had a courage to stop and left a lot of hard work behind (which of course wasn't for nothing) and followed my heart. Because I've been living my dream and working with my passion for several years now. It was just a different path. And yes, many doubted me for sure. But when I realized this thought, it changed my life forever:  You can be anything!‚ù§ So I want to say this to you: Really, don't let your past determine your future. You can be what you want, what makes you happy!",
