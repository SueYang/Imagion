      "description": "Today, in Washington DC, many of my friends and colleagues are taking part in the #climateMarch, an incredibly important statement that I sincerely hope will bring fourth a positive result for further support in this dire issue. It's never been more important, and as a US citizen it saddens me that it isn't taken more seriously by people with the power to make appropriate decisions in my country. How this is still an issue of politics is sincerely daunting. Having worked on the front lines on stories surrounding climate change with scientist, biologists, researchers and documenting the affects first hand, I can say with a clear conscience that it's going to take us all to make a difference. I hope we can all do our part to make a change, it matters more now than ever.",

These media outlets planted a seed in me at an early age, a desire to want to see these places first hand. The #Kalahari was one of those areas and it's been a dream come true to finally experience it. Tonight we finished up yet another incredible day here in a quite meadow at twilight, telling stories about the day and watching the stars slowly take over the night sky. This was the last photo I shot, a #camelThornTree surrounded by lush grass during the tail end of the rainy season. I'm sincerely grateful for these moments. üôèüèª @danahrichardson @kosie_lategan @tswalu",

      "description": "Wild dogs affectionately playing before heading out to hunt. I could have watched this for hours but it lasted only a few minutes before the pack moved into the thick forest in hot pursuit. We were lucky to catch the beginning of a hunt as they chased a wildebeest madly through the trees before moving in too far to follow or even see. All and all a very lucky encounter and one @danahrichardson and I will never forget! @singita_",
