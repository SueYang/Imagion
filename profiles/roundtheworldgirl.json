      "description": "As you may already know, President Trump signed an executive order yesterday calling for a review of national monuments, saying that national monument designations \"create barriers to achieving energy independence.. and otherwise curtail economic growth.\" Perhaps what's being ignored here is that the outdoor industry provides the US economy with $887 billion in consumer spending annually and also provides 7.6 million Americans with jobs. This poses a very real threat to lands that have been preserved for future generations as well as posing a threat to the livelihood of many. If you'd like to help to defend America's public lands, voice your concerns to Secretary Zinke at 202.208.6416.",

      "description": "I like protecting the environment. I like breathing good air, drinking clean water, and growing food in healthy soil. I'm more lucky than many Americans because I generally have access to all three. I know that government regulations can be annoying, but I also know that most of us are game to throw support behind living in healthy ecosystems - behind LIVING - so we're willing to abide by it. \nThe Environmental Protection Agency has asked Americans to comment on the agency's mission and future. Through a Federal Register notice last week, we (America) got notice that the EPA is soliciting public comments on their regulations up until May 15. EPA's stated goal is to \"listen to those directly impacted by regulations, and to learn ways the agency can work together with its state and local partners to ensure that they can provide clean air, land, and water to Americans.\" More specifically, EPA is \"seeking input on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification.\" Comments may be offered in writing, via email, or through EPA's online docket. \nRecommendations: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) have all created legal frameworks that have helped to protect human well-being, and such laws remain in force. Improving and strengthening the above would benefit Americans. As for those \"directly impacted\" by the decisions the EPA will make in the next few months, well, that's the entire human community. So consider taking a few minutes to send an email, write a letter, or head over to the EPA Regulatory Reform Website (link in bio - click the blue \"Comment\" button) to weigh in on the fate of a whole lot of us. Cheers. ‚úåüèº",

Imagine the difference between visiting the summit of a tall mountain via a gondola vs. visiting the summit after an entire day of grueling effort. Which one would be more appreciated/memorable? Or in the case of this photo, experiencing the worlds largest natural bridge after several days of arranging logistics in a foreign country, getting giardia along the way, and rafting a remote canyon for a few days with portages and whitewater to navigate. It is possible to visit this place in a single day, but I know it would never have been so magical and appreciated without the persistence and dedication it took to complete the entire journey. In the age of instant gratification, we are always looking for the quickest way to do anything, but it's taking those shortcuts that steal gratification in the end.\nPC: @moonmountainman",

In fact, the only reason I said yes was because I had a back injury preventing me from skiing, so I figured it would be an alright way to pass the time while I healed up. Now that the trip is over and I'm back in the States, I can only shake my head at my original thought process. The places that river took us were amongst the most beautiful and remote places I've ever been in my life. Travertine waterfalls, lush jungles, parrot-filled caves, awesome rapids - the list goes on...
