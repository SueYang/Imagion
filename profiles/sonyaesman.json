      "description": "\"All of this is just an unfolding of a story line. A drama. How will it come out? How did it come out? And you are just sort of watching this story unfold. It has nothing to do with me. Because I‚Äôm not that. That‚Äôs just a set of phenomena happening. And when you look at yourself as a set of phenomena, what is to judge? I mean is that flower less than that?¬† It‚Äôs just different than that.¬† And you begin to appreciate your uniqueness without it being better or worse. It‚Äôs just different. And cultivating an appreciation of uniqueness, rather than preference, is a very good one. You will see that that judge is inside.¬† And you keep giving it power by identifying with it. And you feel yourself at war with yourself. That there is a part of you that is doing it, and there is a part of you that is judging what you are doing. And as you are quieter, you see the dynamics between the Superego, the Id, the ego. And you see it all as just phenomena. Stand back and get outside of it. To see it for what it is. As just stuff ‚Äî phenomena.\" -Ram Dass",
