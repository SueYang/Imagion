      "description": "Ogallala aquifer water mining for agriculture has left families outside Clovis, New Mexico, completely dry. Buffy Berdoza's family has been carrying water in 5-gallon buckets in the back of their pickup for four years. There are 88,000 agricultural wells just across the state line in Texas that now average around 200 gallons a minute. Originally, these wells pulled around 1000 gallons a minute out of the aquifer but have depleted it to the point that some wells can barely fill a cow tank. Buffy's daughter, Jasmine (in photo above), quit her job and came home to to carry water when Buffy had health issues. Jasmine makes multiple trips to Clovis to haul water every day in twenty one 5-gallon plastic buckets in the back of a small pickup truck. #water #ogallala #aquifers #agriculture #newmexico #watermining  @thephotosociety @natgeocreative",

      "description": "There are six great aquifers in the world. In North America our great aquifer is the Ogallala—it stretches from South Dakota to the Texas panhandle. Twenty percent of our food and 40 percent of our beef rely on the aquifer. It’s unfortunate that we’ve pumped the equivalent of two Lake Eries out, setting the stage for a new desert in the Texas panhandle and southern Kansas in the immediate future.\n\nThe aquifer recharges at different rates. Nebraska wins the water lottery; it is the only place you can see Ogallala water at the surface. The Ogallala takes a long time to recharge in Texas, where there are the most wells, the least regulation, the hottest temperatures (even before climate change), and the slowest recharge. Entire communities in this area are already running out of water.\n\nScarcity of water, fragile infrastructure, small dust bowls, the family farm crisis, Big Ag, and global urbanization leave some behind with few options. Small towns are disintegrating around their residents. There is rampant meth and opioid addiction in some of these places. If your hot water heater breaks, there isn’t anyone in your entire county that can fix it.\n\nI am from the Midwest, and the pain rural folks have gone through showed up this election. I saw this frustration first-hand working on the Ogallala aquifer story that ran in the August 2016 issue of National Geographic, but I never thought the level of frustration of these communities would manifest itself in this way. @natgeo @natgeocreative @thephotosociety",

In general as the water runs out in the Ogallala aquifer, smaller towns in this area will dry up and disappear first. To be FAIR… There is a strip of McDonald’s like businesses outside the CBD… and the town does claim the smallest TV station run by a wonderful mother and son team. To see the video they did of me google Muleshoe Channel 6 and Randy Olson. @natgeo @natgeocreative @thephotosociety",

At one point, she only had 90 days of water left for 16 families (teachers are housed at school complex). The well got down to 15 feet of standing water. Lazbuddie as well as towns all the way north to South Dakota depend on the Ogallala aquifer. There are 88,000 wells around her in the TX panhandle and the area has the least water from the aquifer underneath, the least regulation, the least recharge and the highest density of wells.
