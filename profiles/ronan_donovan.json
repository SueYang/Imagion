After losing her arm in a chimpanzee attack, Teddy is limited in how she can contribute to her families daily chores. 'I'm only able to do small amounts of work, like picking ground-nuts [peanuts] for 1,000 shillings [25 cents] per day .'\nTeddy's story represents one of the faces of deforestation here in Uganda. As the unprotected forests are cleared, wild animals are forced to look elsewhere for food. Since a taboo against consuming primates exists in Uganda, the chimpanzees remain in these tiny slivers of forests. After years of negative interactions with humans, chimpanzees have become aggressive towards people as the chimpanzees are forced to raid crops and wander past village homes.\nI'm currently in the field exploring stories similar to Teddy's. I'll post a series of photos of Teddy and the rest of her story over the coming days. Please stay tuned.",

Chimps don't normally eat jackfruit, these chimps have been forced to adapt. \nThis community of 22 chimps have lost 85% of the natural forest they depend on to small scale logging. It's literally death by 1,000 cuts or 1,000 felled fruiting trees these chimps need to persist. \nWhat is the future of hundreds of chimpanzees, like this one, living in tiny forest patches on private land here in western Uganda? I'm here with the @bulindichimps to explore the idea of coexistence with our closest living relatives - chimpanzees. \n#chimpanzee #greatape #wildlife #onassignment #africa #uganda @thewcs @wwf",

      "description": "Uganda for @natgeo // The alpha male of a small community of 22 chimpanzees pauses while climbing a vine into the canopy to sunbath in the morning sun. Named Sylvester by researchers, he's a prime aged male in his early 30s. \nSylvester has seen his once large riverine forests dwindle by 85% durning his lifetime and at current deforestation rates, he may live to see them completely disappear. But chimps like Sylvester are resourceful and incredibly resilient, making a living now primarily outside of these privately owned forests. Evening raids on villagers mango and jackfruit trees is how Sylvester and his family survive. They will persist on these private forest patches until tolerance by the village community shifts. The conservation goal in this region is to make the remaining forests profitable for the owners through the international carbon credit market, a process that is still years away from being implemented on the ground. \nHang on Sylvester.

      "description": "Uganda for @natgeo // Chimpanzees living on small tracts of privately owned forests in western Uganda have lost over 85% of their natural fruiting trees to small scale logging. As a result, they've begun to exploit the alternatives, which are fruiting trees planted by humans.\nPatrick (left) and Moses measure the circumference of a large fruiting mango tree located 50ft away from a village home. This tree is visited by wild chimpanzees who have adapted to essentially stealing fruit from these subsistence farmers. Patrick and Moses are adding to a data set of the changing foraging habits of a group of 22 wild chimpanzees.\nThis overlap between humans and chimpanzees can lead to a multitude of conflicts from disease transfers to physical attacks - both of which have been recorded. At current rates of deforestation, by 2025 all of these privately owned forests will be logged for timber and charcoal and cleared for agriculture.\nI'm exploring what this means for the people and the 300+ chimpanzees that are living side-by-side on private land. Their futures are both linked to these forests. \nWhat does coexistence look like? I'm hoping to find out. \n#NatGeo #uganda #africa #chimpanzee #conservation #greatape",

They study me for 10 minutes, bobbing their heads up and down to take in as much information about me: my clothes, hat, backpack, camera and most importantly, my face. \nI'm at an advantage to other humans because I'm standing alongside a field assistant, named Tom Sabiiti, who has been working with these chimpanzees for close to 10 years. \nThey know him and trust him. And by association, I'm not seen as an immediate threat, but one still worth keeping an eye on.\n\nChimpanzee facial recognition is similar to ours in judging a familiar face or a strangers. This evolutionary trait served us well in our hunter gatherer days when making that split second judgment could result in serious injury or death - fiend or foe.\nWild chimpanzees still live under threat from both other chimpanzee communities as well as their closest relatives, humans. \nI'll be posting from the field for another month while I look at the future of chimpanzees living outside of protected areas in rural Uganda. \n#hoima #africa #uganda #chimpanzee #greatape #wildlife",
