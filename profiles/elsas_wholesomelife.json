      "description": "Dogs may be a small part of your life, but to them, your are all of theirs üêæ these past two days have been tough, like real tough. üíî Our foster baby Pasar passed away due to internal damage from being crushed as a baby (likely due to human harm) and she found her peace in @gypsea_lust 's arms on the way to the vet two nights ago. \nPasar and her sister, Babi were found by two really amazing & caring tourists in a market (\"Pasar\" in Indonesian) in Ubud, where they most likely had been dumped, and were only 4 weeks young. Pasar had a broken femur and damage to her inside which was making breathing difficult. The girls reached out to us to help so we took them in as our foster babies because who could say no to two gorgeous helpless creatures. For the past week we had taken on the mum life; 3am feeds, cuddles to sleep, bathing, lots of üí© and so many kisses. And we can feel comforted knowing that Pasars final days were filled with soo much love üíò \nBut this is just one of the millions of tragic stories for puppies & dogs here in Indonesia. We fostered these babies through an amazing organisation in Bali called @barc4balidogs where they run off donations and volunteers to help the dogs of Bali. I know that so many of you would love to help out this cause but live in all parts of the world so fostering or adoption isn't really an option, so I have decided to donate 100% of my EBOOK sales over the next week to @barc4balidogs even if you already have a copy or don't even want one, that small donation of $20AUD could really make a difference to a baby like Pasars life! Click the link in my bio üê∂üòáüíî ps. Babi is still here with us, full of puppy beans, bringing us light when everything feels dark üêæ",

I have a recipe in my ebook) \n1 tbsp coconut flakes\n2 tsp cacao nibs \nHow to make:\n1. Add the dragonfruit/berries, peanut butter, dates and half of the coconut yogurt to a blender, blend smooth. \n2. Sprinkle the granola, coconut and nibs in the popsicle moulds and pour over the mixture, spoon the rest of the coconut yogurt over and give it a little swirl with a popsicle stick.\n3. Place in the freezer to set overnight. \n4. Eat straight from the freezer! \nOptional yummy extra: you may like to melt down dark chocolate and pour a couple of teaspoons over the set pops and sprinkle with extra granola, coconut and nibs. \nI use silicone popsicle moulds which I found on eBay üôà \n#cocobella #ad",
