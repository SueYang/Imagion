      "description": "It's been a while since I've shared a progress photo. I came across the photo on the left of eka pada viparita dandasana recently and wanted to share the differences from then and now. First and most importantly, this isn't about what I was doing wrong in 2014 as much as this is about how my body has changed since then, allowing deeper range of motion. On the left, my elbows aren't yet under my shoulders. Since then, I've gained range of motion in my shoulders and am able to find the joint stack. I'm pressing my shoulder blades onto my back ribs to draw my chest forward, creating more space for my low back to lengthen. My leg isn't extended quite as high. This could be due to more flexibility in my hamstrings and more strength in my hip flexor. My foot is flat on the left and my hands are about a foot distance from my foot. I'm high on the ball of my foot on the right, grabbing my foot with my hands. Coming up onto the ball of my foot creates spaces for my low back to lengthen, which allows me to tighten my wheel without risking intense low back compression. These changes in my body didn't happen over night, there was no pill or tea involved üòú. It's a patience game, shifts can be very slow when done safely. It's been so fun sharing my journey with this virtual world üåé‚ù§Ô∏è My leggings on the right are by @myinnerfire from their newest Gypsea collection. Happy Sunday IG! .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#yoga #progress #transformation #healthylife #healthyliving #fitness #instafit #fitnessmotivation #inspiration #growth #change #dedication #motivation #balance #breathe #flexible #stretch #backend",

      "description": "It's day 11 already for #TwistOutTheToxins tomorrow! The pose is \"grasshopper prep\" or parivrtta utkatasana (revolved chair) variation. Not only is this pose a deep, detoxing twist, but a great hip opener as well. ‚ù§ Beginning in utkasana (fierce pose, but for the sake of this description, I'll refer to it as chair pose), you'll want to sit deep in your chair pose. Toes light, four corners of the feet rooting down, knees together. Move into a one-legged char or figure four shape by crossing an ankle over the opposite knee. Line of the outer edge of the top foot with your thigh. As you stay deep in your chair, inhale to lengthen your spine and exhale to twist. (If your right foot is on top, you'll twist to the left) From here, you'll connect the sole of your top foot to the same arm tricep (Right foot, right arm). If this connection isn't happening right now, keep hands in prayer and work the twist without the connection. Remember - this is a path! Stop anywhere along the way. If the connection is made, inhale the arms open. If your bottom hand reaches the floor, use finger tips to aid in stability and lengthening the spine. A block is helpful here as well. I'm challenging my balance a bit more by grabbing my bottom foot with my hand. Taking the gaze up will further add to the balance challenge! Work to keep hips square and stack shoulders. Don't forget to breathe! Check in with @karlatafra tomorrow evening for our last day, day 12. Big thanks to the rest of the crew - @pocketdwarf and @rebeccaleann_ and sponsor @yoga_democracy. I'm wearing the Damask Me Again leggings from the @robinmartinyoga collection. üíôüòäThanks so much for coming to class and snapping this for me after @caseybrevigphotography - and for the shelter from the storm! üòòüôèüèª .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#yoga #balance #breathe #twist #fitness #fitnessmotivation #fitfashion #stretch #strong #lines #angles #flexible #challenge #yogachallenge #healthylife #healthyliving #instayoga #igyoga",

      "description": "Tomorrow's pose, day 7, for #TwistOutTheToxins is ardha matsyendrasana - Half Lord of the Fishes pose or seated spinal twist. ‚ù§Ô∏è Start seated, draw your knees up towards your torso, then slide your right foot (or left, but for the sake of this description, we'll go with right) under your left leg to the outside of your left hip. Step the left foot over the right leg and plant your foot on the floor. The left knee will point straight up. Take your left hand behind your back, lengthen the arm and use the palm or fingertips to help lengthen spine. Place your right upper arm on the outside of your left thigh near the knee. Draw your front torso and inner left thigh together - beginning to twist the torso away from your legs, twisting open to the left. Try to keep the shoulders in one line. Press the inner left foot into the floor and lengthen the front body. Lean the upper torso back slightly while lengthening the tailbone into the floor. With every inhalation lift through the chest, pushing the fingertips against the floor to lengthen the spine. Twist a little more with every exhale breath. ‚ù§Ô∏è Intensify with a bind! Check in with @karlatafra tomorrow evening for day 8. Big thanks to the rest of the crew - @pocketdwarf and @rebeccaleann_ and sponsor @yoga_democracy. I'm wearing the Robin's Roses leggings from the @robinmartinyoga collection. üåπüòä‚ù§Ô∏èüì∑ by the beautiful @karlatafra üòòüôèüèª #twist #challenge #balance #fitness #breathe #blackandwhitephotography #blackandwhite #bnw #bnw_captures #strong #stretch #igyoga #igfitness #instafit #rose #fitfashion #healthylife #healthyliving #yoga #yogachallenge",

      "description": "Parivrtta Navasana or revolved boat pose for day 3 (tomorrow) of #TwistOutTheToxins! üíóThis pose offers all the benefits of navasana with the added twist! To move into this one, start by setting up navasana (boat pose). Sit on the floor or ground with your legs out in front of you, hands just behind the hips, fingers pointing toward the feet. Press through the palms to lift the sternum and lengthen the spine (try to avoid rounding the spine). Lean back slightly, and find balance on sit bones and tailbone. Begin to lift your feet, bend your knees and draw your knees toward your chest. For the sake of this explanation, take your left ankle and cross it under your right ankle. With the knees bent, reach your left hand across and take the big toe of your left foot with your first and middle fingers. As you work to straighten your legs, begin to reach your right arm back. Inhale to lift long through the spine, exhale to twist open to the right. Gaze to the right to challenge the balance. Keep hands grounded and knees bent (even toes on the floor, if needed) and twist open to modify. Check in with @karlatafra tomorrow evening for day 4.
