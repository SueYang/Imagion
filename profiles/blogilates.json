I'm so grateful to be growing the #Blogifam with talented, smart and passionate individuals who actually CARE. It's not easy finding good people. Oh boy...Trust me. My 20s were all about learning what it meant to be backstabbed by my closest confidants. Taken advantage of for my trust in people. Steered in the wrong direction ON PURPOSE because certain \"friends\" wanted to see me fail. With age comes wisdom, experience and the ability to see past the fakeness early on. Growing the fam is a slow process. But I'd sooooo rather have that than rapidly hiring and firing. I'm ALL about the culture of our company. Skills can be learned. But a positive spirit and a good heart need to be innate. This company was founded on the principles passion, loyalty, trustworthiness, and kindness. And I'm obsessed with protecting the magic we've created. ‚ú® Love you guys! ‚ô•Ô∏è #blogilates #poparmy",

Only a little üòÇ) If you feel like you're dragging yourself to exercise, you gotta change it up! I've had many phases...a weight lifting phase, a dance phase, a running phase etc - I do this to keep my body guessing and to keep my mind excited and always learning! Yesterday I did Hot Yoga because my hamstrings have been sooooo stiff from all the sprints I've been doing on the treadmill. üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And the change in pace felt beautiful! Don't be afraid to switch it up. No workout is superior to another - it's about how much enthusiasm and energy you put into each one that makes it effective. Wearing all @popflex_active",

When the second workout comes out the following week - do the workout from week 1 and the new workout from week 2 at least once each...until you work up to 6 days a week on the 6th week. Make sense? Remember...the challenge is at least once a week for the new workouts...but no one is stopping you from doing it more!

Because I PROMISE - when you do - you're opening the doors to a natural stress reliever and a happiness machine! You don't have the pick the hardest workout that burns the most calories. Just do something active! Walk! Dance! Stretch! Whatever! Just move. I promise you will feel so much better. Take care of yourself. Love you. üì∑ by @samlivits #blogilates",
